       "' I wouldn\\'t recommend British Airways at all. I tried to call to customer service for 3 times in different days and time and I waited for more than 30 minutes on the phone! I ended hanging up. They are excusing themselves in the high volume of calls. I write an email an I am still waiting for 2 weeks!  Website is difficult to navigate. It is not easy really to have an invoice of proof of receipt or look for another service. They sent you online but you don\\'t receive a PDF file. So if you need a proof of flight, you need to do screenshots. And, once the flight is flown, you have no access to that booking again to reprint any document or try to create a PDF. You need to contact with a customer service which I did it online, long waiting time, and had to wait more than a week to receive it. Expensive and poor, almost inexistent customer service and difficult to use their website. An airline that definitely wouldn\\'t recommend. It is such a shame that in 2023 they are still in this position and sleeping when they have competitors around  Literally the worst flight of my life. After booking tickets together with my partner, we were then separated: ‘sorry, the flight is full.’ The flight then took off 45 minutes late - no apology. The trolley service took over two hours and they periodically skipped rows, and the response was flippant and rude: ‘whoops. Not sure how that happened. What do you want?’ Genuinely appalling from beginning to end. Might as well fly Easy Jet - at least they charge a price commensurate with the poor quality of service, not like BA  Obviously many airlines have gone downhill in recent years. Prices have increased and services have gone down. The most disappointing thing about BA is that aspects that really don’t need to get worse have. The check in staff at Heathrow are downright rude and abusive, shouting at passengers to line here and there and rolling their eyes if passengers get confused with the constant shouting and bullying. Airlines are now competing globally more and more and this behaviour is particularly noticeable in Asia where the service industry is next level. I wouldn’t want to suggest that all the staff are like this and many younger employees are polite and helpful. However there were a couple of older staff that were downright rude and obnoxious.   Generally poor. Sent to gate on time, sat maybe 30 minutes, was then announced as crew were not familiar with the A321 there would be a delay. Clearly nonsense and there was a retraction on board of this statement. Watched the crew walk through to the gate, my impression was they did not want to be there. Was given a miniscule amount of water, small bag of pretzels and then it was announced there would be a wait for any further cabin service as card processing machines were u/s. No further updates or sight of crew for next two hours, then attempted to charge us for even a glass of water. When I said this should be complimentary, girl said it was not her problem and walked away.  I was horrified by the extremely small seats and the poor training that the crew clearly receives. Not one of them exuded any kind of warmth or expressed any desire to make our journey pleasant. The seats were so narrow that regardless of the size of your neighbors you are forced to touch each other constantly, if the seat in front of you is reclined you have no choice but to recline your own, or else you are breathing in the head/ scalp of the person in front of you. Food was revolting, they don\\'t even provide napkins unless you ask with the pre-meal drinks and the secondary meal. The last time I flew BA it was a completely other experience and I was so sorry to see how far the quality level has slid. It was really majorly disappointing and I regret that I have already purchased 2 other intercontinental trips with the company. I will now have to see if I can change them. The pathetic 250 ml bottle of water, it\\'s just a sip. On the shorter flights the seats couldn\\'t even be reclined which was a great pity since the flight was delayed by almost 3 hours and we had to wait on board.  A catalogue of failures. We flew from Belfast to Heathrow a week ago and the flight was delayed by over three and a half hours. We missed our onward Air Canada flight to Calgary as a result. On arriving in Calgary (after re-routing via Vancouver which added over 6 hours to our journey) we met other passengers who had also missed the same Air Canada flight as their British Airways flight from Manchester had also been delayed by several hours. We are now on our way home only to find our Heathrow to Belfast flight, which had already been cancelled and put back 2 hours, is now delayed by another 2 hours. Avoid British Airways like the plague.  If I could give a minus rating, I would. Supposed to be LHR-AMS at 14.05 on 13th March. Get to LHR at 12.00, email to say flight cancelled. No one able to help at LHR, said to use the app. Only halfway sensible option was from LCY-AMS at 17.05, so taxi over there as trains from LHR not working (ok, not BA\\'s fault). Get to LCY, showing as cancelled on screen, so check the app and there it is. Rebook again via the app to the 15.30 departure, go to desk to drop bag and was told that I was only on standby for the flight, with no guarantee of a seat, despite the app telling me it was confirmed. The 18.35 to AMS was already overbooked so was moved onto the 19.30 flight to Rotterdam. The 15.30 and 18.35 were both cancelled anyway, as it happened. Eventually took off and the best thing I can say is that it landed intact. Return from AMS-LHR, similar story. Arrive at AMS, screen shows the 21.00 is cancelled. Quickly check app, and confirmed it was. No emails, no texts, nothing. Rebooked via app to the 22.00 departure, so could have been worse. Desk agent helpfully printed me a boarding card as the app was unable to issue anything for a rebooked flight. Overall, dreadful. They just don\\'t care and hide behind apps and automated call centres. Avoid unless you have no other option, and even then stop and consider if you \\'really\\' need to go.  This was literally one of the worst experiences. I haven’t been to an airport since. It began in Orlando flying back the flight plan system went down and we were stuck on the tarmac for 6 hours. Poor customer service and just ignored at times. Then missed my connecting flight and we were told not to leave the baggage area without our bags. Even though I booked through to Dublin. Another 4 hours I was told my bags were lost and to continue to the desk to book a flight. Another hour later I was handed a card with a number and told to ring it. I was cut off three times and told I wouldn’t be able to get home that day despite several flights being available. Just booked my own flight and had lost my suit and presents for Christmas and missed an engagement party.  At 7.54 am on the day of travel whilst driving to London Heathrow I received an email advising my flight had been cancelled. I was offered an alternative flight with American Airlines which I had no alternative but to accept as I must travel today. I was flying to LA to see a family member who is end of life. The American Airlines desk downgrade my cabin from premium economy to economy. Tried 3 times BA provide telephone number, total useless, no help, given me wrong email address for sending my complains given to me in the email. I have been a BA frequent flyer for decades and have been a loyal customer. I now find I am travelling 11 hours in Economy without even the possibility of a refund let alone an upgrade. This is completely unacceptable. What has happened to this company? I have had better treatment from Ryanair.  Flew premium, only worth the extra money for the bit of extra room. Penny pinching means there’s no other benefit - one drink service on 10 hour flight, no fizz offered before take off, poor food, boarding was badly organised. Food left on tables 30 min before landing with no tea and coffee offered. Few small cups of water passed around but nothing “premium” about this. New planes have been decorated terribly - feels like you’re in a dentist waiting room. Devoid of any personality or joy. Only fly if the only option, only fly premium if it’s not too expensive - seriously not worth much more than economy these days, especially if you’re in the middle 4.  My review relates to the appalling experiences I had with British Airways on 14th February 2023. I was due to travel to Madrid with British Airways and before setting off I heard on the radio that there were flight delays. I looked at the Heathrow Airport website and saw that my flight had been cancelled. As a result of the information on the website, I called British Airways and have 26 minutes on hold I found myself speaking to somebody in a call centre in South Africa. The person was hard to understand due to a heavy accent and he was incompetent and insisted that the flight was not cancelled. I made my way to Heathrow and sure enough the flight was indeed cancelled. The woman in question had the audacity to declare that the flight was cancelled and that “there are no facilities here at the airport to rebook you”. She refused to let me and about 12 other people join the queue for the clearly marked assistance desk. The same woman and one of her colleagues gave out a card with a telephone number and told one rather elderly gentleman to “go online to rebook your seat”. I am visually impaired and found the attitude of the BA employee to be appalling. I called the number on the card the employee gave me and was again in a long queue to a call centre. The person who picked up the phone kept me waiting 22 minutes and declared that the flight was not cancelled and that the airport “must be wrong”. He then in a flippant tone said he was just informed that the flight was indeed cancelled and that I would have to go and speak to IBERIA customer services in Heathrow to rebook! I took the elderly gentleman with me to IBERIA where the counter staff member rolled her eyes in disgust and said that it was nothing to do with IBERIA. I returned to BA and this time I joined the check-in line and told a check-in agent what had happened. The man in question booked me onto the next available flight within a matter of a few minutes. He gave me a £30 voucher as a form of compensation but said he could not add my frequent flyer number with a partner airline. The voucher proved useless I am afraid as various shops in the predepature area refused to accept it and although I was told I could use it after clearing security none of the shops would accept it. Once aboard my new flight the service was minimal. Other than a tiny bottle of water and a packet of pretzels nothing else was available. This was a full flight as so many people had been transferred from the cancelled flight. BA Cabin crew announced that any additional items other than the small bottle of water and pretzels had to be ordered via their skyshop.  Outward journey BA245 London to Buenos Aires Club World 10 January 2023. Our experience was poor from beginning to end. Although we had reserved seats 11F and 12J, another passenger was occupying 11F and crew made no attempt to address the problem. Eventually, I persuaded the passenger to move and occupy her designated seat 11D. We boarded punctually but were not offered drinks. When I asked for a drink, the crew member said it was too late and blamed the seating problem. The same crew member then began taking orders for dinner but did not write them all down and gave up after a few minutes for the safety briefing. She asked us to repeat our orders later. The hot flannels smelled musty and felt old and ragged.  One of the crew wondered aloud whether my companion and I were related.  My soup was cold, I was told it was served from flasks. Was that an explanation or an excuse? My coffee was weak and tasted like instant granules. My companion was initially served no bread roll with dinner. The breakfast menu stated a \\'selection of rolls/pastries\\' but there was no choice and my companion was given a dried fruit pastry, where he would have chosen a bread roll.  Although we had not previously asked for or been offered any other than those supplied at the seat, small bottles of water ran out. Return journey BA244 Buenos Aires to London Heathrow World Traveller Plus 26 January 2023 was a huge contrast, from the warm welcome on boarding to crew’s professionalism throughout. It’s a poor reflection on Club World service that our experience in World Traveller Plus was so much better and kinder. Weighed against the advantages of a flat bed, the considerable price difference was not worth paying for the catalogue of errors and inconveniences outlined above. Check in agent at LHR was very helpful and friendly as were the in flight crew. Seat was comfortable with good leg room. However, the food was poor - barely better than economy class with a poor quality and limited selection of wine. In flight entertainment selections we’re very limited. Far inferior to what BA used to offer. Overall, this premium economy product was disappointing and very poor value for money. Definitely not recommended, especially for business class. The seats are ridiculous and small, the food is mediocre if that, and good luck with the internet even if you pay for full internet for the entire flight. The service however has been great. My attendant saved me from crying. I don’t know who designed this aircraft but in this expensive business class, in order to move out of you middle seat to go to the bathroom you must rudely climb over the person’s legs sitting in the aisle seat. Your seat is like an enclosed tiny cubicle with no storage space. I’ve unfortunately traveled British Airways business class at least 4 times within the last 4 months. Never again unless there is no other choice. By the way, the business class lounge south at Heathrow is a cattle pen.  Absolutely terrible experience with British Airways. After a short flight from London Heathrow to Frankfurt, they couldn\\'t get my suitcase to me in time for my next flight (on Cathay Pacific) to Melbourne, despite a 3 hour gap between the two flights. Told me they would arrange for the suitcase to be transferred directly to Melbourne - instead, it got to Hong Kong and left there. When they finally tracked it down, they sent it back to London. All happened over Christmas, so very stressful yet minimal communication from their team. While the plane crew may be lovely, the service outside of this has been nothing short of dreadful, and if given the option, I will avoid flying with them in future. Turned up 3.5 hours in advance, Terminal 5 at London Heathrow was already carnage, 100s of people trying to check in, only 5 desks manned. Long queues at security due to only 4 lines open. People stressed, pushing, shouting, and flight delayed by 2 hours, according to pilot delay due to suitcases all needing to be loaded. Missed connecting flight in Doha, 12 hours wait til next one. Received a voucher, approx £6 for the whole day. Arrived 1 day later, my suitcase didn’t arrive with me. Filed a claim at the desk, for 5 days no update, no information, no offer of compensation and no solution offer. I now have a spoilt holiday, many personal belongings are gone, xmas gifts missing, extensive expenses I don’t know if I will be reimbursed. Beware with BA, expect low level or zero customer service, old planes, and zero help if anything goes wrong or missing. I will personally avoid BA in future at all costs.  Stupidly tried BA again after a five year gap and paid over £7000 for my wife and I to go to Barbados because I thought the new Business Class layout might rival Virgin Atlantic on the route. About six months ago BA announced they were switching planes to the old antique push-me-pull-you layout but it was too late to reorganise our holiday logistics. Sure enough we suffered the most appallingly uncomfortable flights with no room (eight seats across), worn out fittings, inedible food and surly FAs. Extremely sub-par service. Highlights: No online meal selection. Staff pretty much dropped off whatever meal they had and were very rude if a passenger wanted it changed. Last meal was delayed to the last 40 minutes of flight. Plates were literally grabbed away. I had to hand over my unfinished plate that the staff again dropped on me. No apology. No offer of a napkin. I had to scrounge for a piece of paper to clean my jacket. None of the passengers were told to straighten up their seats before meal. Because the seat before me was so tilted, I could barely keep the plate on the tray without things slipping off. Staff walked down with some water and biscuits. This got exhausted just before she got to me. She just looked at me and walked away. Nothing further was offered.  Flying LHR T5 to CPT November 2022:  BA app and website not working properly - would not load my ticket. LHR T5 smooth and calm. Checking process quick. - But boarding card would not scan at security, they gave me one for someone else to a different destination.  Ran back to checkin to get correct one. Bags also tagged incorrectly and had disappeared.  Someone ran off to find my bags in the depths of T5 and retag them (amazingly they did show up in Cape Town).  Told only main lounge was open not B and C pier lounges. Turns out this was false information ... B Pier lounge was open. But I was in main lounge which was overcrowded and worn out. -Arrived late to the gate (train not working). There was a Biz class lane (quick) but then a giant queue to get on the plane as they only had one airbridge, not two. Seat comfy and cabin clean but the sinks were taped up as the waste was not working. I was offered hand sanitiser instead but this is disgusting (imagine going to the bathroom and not being able to wash your hands as there is no sink). Unbelievable that BA dispatches planes in this condition. Food average. Wine served way too late (choice of wine with cold food, or eat food first and matching wines come a quarter of an hour later). Overall experience 2/10. Flew Air France (Fortalaza to CDG to LHR) two weeks earlier which was way better. How embarrassing for BA.  Check in was a shambles at BWI, just 3 counters open for a very full flight. The bag drop queue was even longer than the regular check-in queue! Boarding was done by zones so that was carried out reasonably well. Once on board, the FAs were fine, not as engaging on my outbound flight to IAD. The aircraft was cramped and the seats in economy were horrible. I was seated in an aisle seat (row F) where there is an entertainment box taking up a third of your legroom. Overall, very cramped seat, poor legroom and awful IFE screens. The meal was mediocre and there was no bar service before the meal this time. On lading, we were served a hot sandwich which had oozing cheese all over the wrapper so it was not pleasant to handle but tasted very good! The plane landed at a remote stand which meant that we had to be bussed to T5 and since it was raining, it was not a nice experience. Overall, I rate this just as a mediocre journey.  I booked the flight on Oct 8, but have to cancel the flight on the same day after learning that I can\\'t get my entry visa in time for the flight. And I did receive a confirmation email says my flight was canceled. But in the cancellation email, the booking reference number is a different one. So I requested cancellation, but BA canceled another person\\'s flight and sent the confirmation to my email? I assumed that my flight was canceled, but after more than 3 weeks, I still have not received any refund, so I reached out, and it turned out my flight is still on?! And it is getting even more ridiculous when you try to reach out to BA. I tried multiple different ways, phone calls, and emails, but none was able to investigate what actually happened nor has the authority help cancel my flight without paying penalty. Based on my experience, no ones reads your email carefully, no matter how much context you put in. Given all I have experienced, I have zero faith in British Airways.  We boarded our flight at Edinburgh to London for our connecting flight to San Francisco on 4th October, there were a lot of Americas heading back to America from Scotland because of the Open Golf at St Andrews. The woman at the counter was rude, I was actually embarrassed to be British at the time. Shouting, snapping at people and just had a real horrible way about her. On the flight from London to San Francisco, prior to the 24 hour check in, I spent £150+ to reserve two seats for our once in a life time holiday to America. Once we boarded, it was evident that the seat I was sitting in was broken. The recliner button was not working and had been pushed into the frame of the arm rest. I asked the flight attendant at the time of there was anything that could be done, but not only was she also rude, but seemed uninterested in that fact that I was going to have to sit for 11 hours on a flight with a seat that wouldn\\'t recline. I eventually got the flight to state that she would report the fault, only to find out that multiple other seats on the economy seating area were also broken. Attitude with British Airways staff has been absolutely horrendous. So, after getting off the flight, I decided to make a complaint to British Airways. Bearing in mind that I had paid £150+ for the privilege of picking a seat. I asked for a refund for the cost of the booking of the seat prior to the 24 hour check in, only to be told no, they don\\'t do refunds. I paid for a product that was broken, met with nothing but rude staff, and they are telling me they can\\'t refund the cost of booking the seat? 4 emails to the customer team and they are still refusing, they are also refusing to tell me whether or not that the fault was reported prior to me sitting in that seat. All they have now offered me is a £50 BA voucher, which I declined on the basis that if they picked my seats (for example I hadn\\'t payed for the seats prior to the 24 hour check in) then a £50 voucher would be ok, but not when I have spent my own money to select a seat that was broken. After all my experiences with BA, I will not be using them again. Very rude and unhelpful staff and I will chose another carrier in the future, im actually ashamed that BA treats people the way they do when they are a national airline for Great Britain.  While entering the aircraft it was very rushed no smooth boarding people were struggling with cabin luggage and finding their seats and heating was high that I was suffocating. I got faint due to that heat, but the cabin crew were very helping so all the thanks to those who helped me at that time. Other then that when I called cabin crew to ask for some water they took half an hour to response.  London to Cairo. First, on this 5 hour mid morning flight the only complimentary food and drink were a tiny bag of pretzels and a small bottle of water. Even Southwest is more generous. When unable to connect my phone to order food, I hit the FA call button with no response for more than an hour. When the FA came to collect garbage I had to show him the call light and he gruffly asked me what was the matter. He used his phone to place the order.  This review is for BA booking system not a flight . Today I clicked wrong date on line, my mistake and expect to pay a fee. I then go to “cancel booking” and click on the option to not receive a voucher, immediately I received a response saying my voucher is on its way. I call them and speak to a gentleman who continuously spoke over me and would not listen to my concerns and eventually I give up and want to book a new flight, obviously at a much higher price but using the voucher I didn’t want. However to my surprise I am unable to use this voucher because they can’t tell me what it is until I receive it at a point in the future that they can’t say when. So they now have my money and I have to re-book at full cost. In the end in order to get me off the phone they hung up.  Our flight in March 2022 from San Francisco to London on 28th March was cancelled with 3 hours’ notice. We found out on the shuttle bus to the airport. We had to stay overnight for the next day flight. We still have not been recompensed for our expenses (filled in on line) and have received no replies on follow-ups. It is the usual 30 min or longer time to wait on customer service picking up. During this trip, we had to re-schedule a return flight (my wife was ill). This should not have been a problem as the flights were re-bookable. We were given a voucher. This voucher was only bookable by phone. When I phoned to rebook, we got the automated voice saying BA were not taking flight bookings by phone. You can see the problem - how do a use a voucher where I must phone and they are not taking phone bookings ? All I have been offered is another voucher. The time to use has passed. It must be great to be a business that can print endless A4 vouchers and not return money paid for services not rendered. We returned home with Aer Lingus with no drama.  I was told I\\'d require a 48 hr negative covid test for entry into Philippines. Booked my trip via BA.com, with a transfer in Singapore. They delay my transfer to the next day, okay, not too bothered as have my 48 hr negative covid test, but when I try to check in at Changi Airport, the Philippines Airlines check in staff require a 24 hr negative covid test. Had to rush to a different terminal, get tested, wait for the result, rush back to check in ...the gate had closed.  Had to book an extra night in Singapore hotel, book my own flight to Manila, then also the return journey back to London. If one misses one leg of a BA booked flight, the remaining flights get cancelled.  I discovered Oman Air Business Class and better then British Airways, from treating their customers, quality of service, the business class experience.  Holidays ruined, 2 suitcases lost in 2 flights I travelled from London Heathrow to Amsterdam with my brother, before boarding we were told we couldn\\'t take our cabin suitcases with us in the cabin, so they sent them to the cargo. At our arrival in Amsterdam, one of the suitcases was missing, left at London Heathrow, so we had to fill in a report in Amsterdam, this was 3 days ago and we still don\\'t have the suitcase or any information about it. Today I travelled from Amsterdam to London City Airport, again they didn\\'t allow me to board with my cabin suitcase, and when I arrived in London, the suitcase was missing, left in Amsterdam. 2 Suitcases, 2 different flights, they\\'ve ruined my holidays. No compensation, no dates on when will I get my property back, no information, lies and more lies.  I was told I could complain online and buy all the things I need, shoes, toiletries, clothes, and I might receive the money back in 30 days! Yes, I might.  Customer service is non-existent. For over a week customer service number message said to call back in a couple weeks. Nothing we needed to accomplish could be done on BA.com I was flying to Nairobi to bring my sister back after her husband died suddenly, My sister and husband had tickets on the July 18 from Nairobi to JFK. When BA received the death certificate, they cancelled my sister\\'s ticket, not once but twice. It took almost 5 weeks to correct this incompetence. My niece and my wife were on the phone for hours plus hold times. 8 times we were told by the web help number we would get a return call and no one ever called back. The ticket was in premium economy. When I tried to upgrade to be with my broken- hearted sister, the price was $4029.00 plus a $25.00 service fee. Where is the efficiency? Where is the empathy? Where is the decency? In addition to the stress of losing her husband, my sister had to go through totally unnecessary stress of not having a ticket until 7 days before her flight. Also when I made my reservation, i was given a price and within 10 seconds was told there was a $1400.00 increase. British Airways has taken a nosedive in my opinion. Words simply don\\'t convey my very deep frustration and disappointment with the company  My wife and I booked a flight in April 2022 that included a return trip from Edinburgh thru London to Washington. When we checked in at Edinburgh Airport 3 hours ahead of time we were informed there were no more seats available on our scheduled flight. We asked how this was possible and were simply told that others had checked in on-line (which we hadn’t done).  We were instructed to come back in 2 hrs and 15 mins, still with our luggage unchecked and not yet going thru security, to see if we could get on the flight via standby. We waited and then finally at 1:15 PM, 45 mins before our scheduled 2:00 PM flight, we were told we could be on the flight and were given boarding passes for the flight to London but no boarding passes for the connecting flight (1:55 mins after arrival time). Our luggage was not checked thru to Washington but only to London. We were told we’d get thru security on time to make the flight and it was suggested that staff would assist us. When we got to Security Check area the line was massively long. We questioned a BA staff member who said we had to get in line like the others. We decided to pay (12 pounds) to go through “Fast Track” Security to make our Flight. We got to the gate in time. Yet, due to a delayed departure caused in part by luggage-space issues on the plane, our flight arrived in London 45 mns late, and after going to the “flight connections” we were told 25 mins before the scheduled departure, with a vague explanation of “there isn’t enough time,” that we could not be given a boarding pass for our flight. We were then directed to baggage claim to retrieve our luggage and then proceed to the check-in area to be rebooked for a later flight. When we got to the check-in counter area a BA staff person, standing at entrance to the check-in line, advised us we should try to call our travel agency to rebook because the line for checking in had not hardly moved in 3 hrs. When we finally got thru on the phone, we were informed that the best BA could do for us was to get us on a flight 5 days later, and then not to our original destination (IAD), but to Baltimore. I was not told or assured I’d be compensated for this extreme expense of staying 5 more days in a hotel - just that I could go to the BA website and make a claim on-line. This ugly experience, still ongoing, has ruined our trip to the UK.   Three flights, London to Reykjavik return and Frankfurt to London. Generally the flights were of an acceptable standard, though the seats and legroom are quite tight for a three-hour flight. The cabin crews were efficient and generally friendly. A big plus for BA was informative announcements from the cockpit, often missing on other airlines. Flights operated generally close to the advertised times. But BA was let down by chaotic check-in and boarding procedures. In preparation for each flight the number of check-in staff was one or at most two (in Frankfurt the lone check-in agent was also checking in Business Class passengers). Why are Economy class passengers boarded from the front and not from the back? This was standard across the three flights, but slowed down the boarding process immensely as people seated further back tried to get past forward seated passengers stowing their (enormous) cabin baggage. It would make much more sense to board people at the back first. And to enforce baggage rules so that cabin crew are not wandering up and down the cabin trying to find overhead space for the hapless passengers who boarded last. The small bottle of water and a half-full bag of crisps offered as a snack on a three-hour flight to Iceland was just tokenism and compared badly with what Air France offered on a subsequent short flight to Paris. At Reykjavik there was no departure lounge next to the gate -- passengers had to queue wherever they could in the corridor.  We left MIA late due to an issue with the provisioning of the plane. We arrived late and so missed our connection at LHR to CDG. At LHR British Airways rebooked us on not 1 but 3 flights to CDG and as such said I never took the flight to CDG and then cancelled my flight back to MIA since I did not take my flight. They did credit my AVIOS for the one flight but said I never took it. Thus I had to book on another airline to return at the last moment. Trying to call BA was a nightmare on hold for over 1 hour, a total of $127 extra on my calling plan only to not be helped as the person did not know what to do so he had us contact duty office who does not handle “flight only” problems feeding us back to the number we just called and we’re unable to be helped. BA cost me $5800 overall. We have flown them for years reaching silver and gold status but never again. They under new leadership have sunk to less than a budget low cost airline in customer service while charging premium rates - don’t be fooled.  The flight was delayed over 6 hours and this of course caused us to missed our connection flight and change to a different route, finally I lost my luggage and no one has any information. I will never again travel with British Airways.  Terrible experience with British Airways! I was obligated to check-in my carry-on suitcase due to my group number, according to the girl at the front desk. Then, they could miss my two suitcases, plus the luggage of my boyfriend, who traveled with me. After 3 days, they delivered 2 of our 3 bags, and since then the promise of deliver the last one persists. Now, already 10 days passed, and still no information of where the last suitcase is. Always the promise that the bag will be delivered today, but it never happens! No respect with the customer! First and last time with British Airways for sure! I don\\'t recommend at all!!  Belfast to London on 20 Jun, 0650. I was informed at about 0200 flight BA1427 has been delayed to 0915, will only reach London Heathrow at 1025. I reached the airport at 0445, but BA counter was only open at 0510. At checkin counter, I approached BA ground staff for advice as I have a connecting Singapore Airlines flight at 1125 on the same day. The reply was “it is the customer’s responsibility to contact the airline, there’s nothing we can do”. I was given a card with contact info on BA customer service and sales. For the next 2 hrs in the airport, I have been trying to contact BA, but was told that hotline only operates from 0800, I have to called another number for “urgent cases”, which ever number I dial, I just couldn’t get to speak to any one till 0757. Again, I was told that there’s nothing they could do because my connecting flight is Singapore Airlines. Onboard the aircraft, when I approached for help with my luggage to be placed to the compartment, I was told that it’s the customer’s responsibility to do it on their own.  I would think twice to take BA in the future.  The customer service of British Airways is really bad. You can\\'t reach any call centre agent even after waiting for 30 mins. Now, I really appreciate Emirates and Turkish Airlines after facing BA\\'s low quality customer service. Not only the customer service but the food they offer during a long haul (LDN-JNB) is really low quality. Other airline operators which are working with Do&Co for flight catering are way better than BA. I guess BA has selected the lowest budget option from Do&Co. Overall my rating is 2/5 for BA - you can feel how stingy BA is when you fly with them. Note: Respect to their cabin crew  This a new route which BA introduced at the beginning of June after several years of Covid related delays. The business class experience was I fear typical of the nickel & dime policies introduced by the airline over the past decade. Plus - helpful and friendly FA. Minuses - The cabin was fairly cramped with six seats across. Each pod had surprisingly little room with only very limited storage space. It was hard to adjust the seat, particularly getting it to lie flat - even the FA found it difficult. The in-flight entertainment was very limited with a poor choice of films, TV programmes and music. The food choice and quality was poor - one of the three mains was unavailable and my pea and mushroom risotto was almost inedible: the cheese selection was also poor. I don\\'t know what the business class offerings from BA\\'s rivals flying similar routes are like, but the experience does not match up to that provided by Singapore Airlines on their flights to the Far East and Australasia.  Right now do not use British Airways. When booking, person said we would have enough time between the connection flight to final destination, but he was wrong. Flight to London was late, we auto missed our flight to Edinburgh, and had to wait 9 hours for the next flight. Coming back once again flight leaving was late, had to run to get connecting flight, then we sat on tarmac for an hour because luggage had to go on so I thought good, that is probably my luggage. Once back in Boston luggage did not show up. They said we would get it within 24 hours and we didn\\'t, so far it will be at least 2 days.  My son travelled alone for the first time to pursue his studies and we were very concerned about any issues he might have especially reading the reviews about the airlines.. But his flight was experience was good with no delays and reached Toronto in time. We are thankful to British Airways to provide a hassle free flight to my son, especially after the troubles the airlines have gone through due to pandemic. Unfortunately, people with good experiences do not post their reviews skewing the reviews negatively. The flight was very expensive though as we booked late, after being dumped by Air Canada / Swiss air, after they cancelled their flight at the last moment.  Check in easy at BGI due to us checking flightradar24 and finding the flight was delayed by nearly 2 hours, no notification from the airlines so other passengers arrived earlier. Easy boarding in sequence numbers. Seat is a joke for 8 hour flight, no leg room on isle seat of 4, the seat in front frame blocks you stretching your legs and once the passenger in front reclines its even worse. Food is mediocre with poor choice and all of the drink choices had run out before the stewardess had arrived to my seat (only choice Coca-Cola, water or red wine. The connecting flight from LHR - MAN was cancelled with no contact from the airline, I only found out trying to book a seat on the return legs, with no alternative flight provided. We had to privately book a taxi from LHR to Manchester for 4 persons as this worked out cheaper than the train. The outbound flight was also a farce, no mention of Terminal change at LHR from 5 to 3, so quick turnaround changing terminals was chaotic and stressful for older relatives travelling with us. Overall shocking from British Airways and can guarantee I will never use them again.  BA says that tickets are flexible and cancellation is free within 24 hrs. That reality is an absolutely miserable alternative. 8 hours after booking, I need to change my flight. I assume I will get a refund like their site says I will - that was apparently a lie. They actually give me a voucher. To request the voucher I have to sign away that I agree to the voucher despite not knowing how much money they will refund me and I might not get it for a week.  I am panicked so I try calling them. Of course, calling them does nothing. The hotline says that they are too busy. This happens again and again. So, I give up, submit the request online despite no guarantee of amount or timing. Luckily it shows up quickly, and I rebook. Then I need to change my booking again. I go to request a voucher again. This time the voucher code doesn\\'t work on the website when I enter it. So here I am needing to rebook with a useless voucher. Finally I call the executive class phone line (which I am not a member of) and then eventually pick up and agree to help me. They do some thing on their back end and tell me that they will send the information to their booking department who will contact me in 72 hours. Basel to Johannesburg via London. Cancelled connection flight: confusing UI, still shows cancelled booking in my bookings, never sent a confirmation email for new flights.  Cant check-in. Could check-in online or via the app. Customer service is non-existent. Busy line, after 45min still no one there to help me check in.  British Airways continues to decline in customer service. I used to love this airline and now I have had three poor experiences back to back regarding their customer service on the phone with flight changes and vouchers. The most recent experience has cost me $3000 more than originally booked due to bad rep advice and multiple calls to the company. Even as part of the Executive Club (Silver) I continue to be left on hold for ages and in the last week have spent over 6 hours on the phone seeking support. At this rate, they have lost my trust.  On my flight from LAX to LHR I paid to pick my seat for my flight back to LAX. I saw the $116 come out of my account the next day. As I’m adding in my booking the day before my flight, the website tells me I no longer have a booked seat and the seat I paid for has been sold to someone else. I spent an hour trying to find a way to contact their customer service and at first was told to DM the airline on Twitter which I find extremely inappropriate but I still reached out anyway because I was unable to find another way to contact them. On Twitter, I was told they were looking for an agent to help me and they never ended up responding. They just left my message unread. After about 6 hours of waiting for a Twitter DM back I ended up being able to find a chat line on their website. While talking to the agent on the chat line she informed me that they sold my seat to another customer and that she would book me a new seat, however she was unable to tell me where the seat was or how many people were in my row. After a frustrating conversation she was able to book me my original seat. Soon after I tried to pull up my booking in the British Airways app and was unable to find it. I would enter the booking reference and the site would say it was a success and the booking would show up once I refreshed the page but it did not. I continued to try and add the booking and the app would do the same thing every time, say it was a success then never add the booking. I’m not able to find the chat line again and I will not DM a company on Twitter with my support issues again. I’m extremely frustrated. Business lounge was closed at Pisa airport which was probably beyond the control of British Airways but as it had been closed since January the least British Airways could have done would have issued their customers who paid for this service vouchers to be used at the airport, I complained about this to BA and as compensation they said they would credit my account with 10000 Avios points which I felt was an adequate compensation and at that point felt BA had handled the situation in a prompt and professional manner. However that was seven weeks ago and no Avios points have been added to my account, I have called their call centre multiple times at one point being put on hold for an hour to put through to the right department, when the phone was answered I was told it was the wrong department and to phone a number which was read out to me which was the same number I was calling! This scenario has replayed itself probably about twenty times now, it is clear that BA have no intention of resolving this and are just making their customer go round in circles before they give up, This airline is absolutely appalling in the way it treats its customers.  Flew back on BA0254 Bridgetown to Heathrow in the old Club Class. A huge disappointment after going out in the new Club Class suites - the end of this awful yin and yang seating can\\'t come soon enough. Even tried to pay BA\\'s extortionate pre-booking rate for our seats - none left to choose even weeks ahead. My wife and I were stuck in the middle 2 seats of 4 - 13E and F. Good job it was an overnighter so we managed to sleep a bit and not have to climb over our neighbours very often. The March film selection so not good. Not particularly friendly FA who insisted face masks must be worn even though BA\\'s policy has changed regarding flying back to a non-mask wearing destination (ie. London). Sort it out BA. Took off 20 minutes late but big tailwind so more than made up the time on a relatively smooth flight. Dinner not to bad but breakfast - fairly dire. My wife\\'s smoked salmon bagel was dreadful. As usual when BA is good, it\\'s really good but when it\\'s bad it\\'s awful. I recommend hesitatingly - come on BA, be great again. We pay a lot for \"premium\" seats.  The worst budget airline I’ve ever used! Far worse than Ryanair and I refuse to fly with them even though they’re basically free. BA charge about 10x as much as other budgets but have the worst service. Spent an hour checking in because their outdated computers crashed. They left us sat on the plane for over 2 hours because they couldn’t connect to the internet, then left 50% of our luggage behind because they would have had to refund everyone’s flights if they waited another 10 mins for the other luggage trolleys to arrive. It took three days to return it and cost us £100s. Then on return I’ve now been sat here nearly two hours and there’s no sign of our luggage again. I don’t know how a company can be this incompetent but I’ll be pursuing for compensation. I have some free flights from Amex but I won’t be using them because it’s not worth going through this again. First, the actual flights are fine and the staff on all 3 flights (ZRH-LHR, GVA-LHR & LHR-ZRH), first 2 in Economy, are absolutely fine, chatty and friendly, they are a credit to the company. The infrastructure however is appalling. ZRH-LHR impossible to check-in online and just 2 staff to check-in everyone for 2 flights resulting in mislabelled luggage and an hour delay to sort this out. GVA-LHR, 2.5hrs late as no-one at LHR to tow the aircraft to the gate. LHR-ZRH, 50mins late due to slow gate staff. Even when you check-in online you have to queue at the airport to get the actual boarding pass! There are more examples, and for this reason, until they sort out their stressed ground staff, it is impossible to recommend this airline. Onboard 10/10, getting to be onboard 1/10.  Our main complaint is that the limited food served was bland, barely edible, and by far the worst we’ve ever experienced compared to other airlines used in the past. The staff were friendly enough but they were rarely seen between meals. No snacks were offered during the flight. This is so different to every other airline we have used in the past. After 14 hours of flying the breakfast offered was a tiny, cold, stale, Ham and cheese roll and a small plain yoghurt with a couple of Oreos. If ever you decide to fly with them I suggest that you bring your own food. We certainly will on our return flight but will never use British Airways again.  Feb 25, 2022. We show up at the airport 3 hours early for our flight to Dublin. we waited in line for 3+ hours to just check in our luggage. After that, we learn our flight is delayed another 3+ hours. We had a connecting flight in London. When trying to go through customs they wouldn\\'t let us through because the boarding of the plane was going to be happening in 30 minutes. They told us to wait in a customer service line that was well over an hour. We then found out we could have gone through customs because the connecting flight from London to Dublin was delayed over an hour. However, by the time we were told this information, the doors were about to close. The next available flight to Dublin was 2/27 late evening. With that being said we were forced to stay the night in London. After talking to a British Airways manager, they informed us that BA would reimburse us for any hotel, flight (to get to Dublin regardless of the airline), clothes (due to them losing our bags), excursions and transportation. Due to this issue, we had to spend multiple days shopping for clothes, lost out on days we had booked to explore the country, had to now buy an extra suitcase for the new clothes we received (went 4 days with lost bags). When we finally got home, we submitted our claims like we were told to do. Within a few days, it\\'s declined. We have asked for a contact # just to talk to somebody, again declined. We tried to reach out via social media and we get passive-aggressive messages.  They refuse to pay me back for the new flight to get to Dublin, transportation to and from the airport in London, the hotel for London, the clothes I had to buy because they lost my bags for 4 days, and the extra luggage fee because of the extra clothes I had to buy. There is no customer support and they are impossible to get a direct response from. I really can’t believe they have the audacity to call this First Class. The check in staff at Singapore were abrupt and unhelpful. The official BA lounge in Singapore was closed, so they’re using a cheap generic alternative, which anyone can pay twenty pounds to go in. Suffice to say it was not pleasant. Onboard was like being in the middle of a bad comedy sketch. I can not believe the two stewardess have ever had any first class training. I had to ask for slippers. The first drink took nearly an hour to arrive, despite only having 8 passengers to serve between the two of them. The poor woman sat next to me ordered a wine, which came filled to the brim. I mean it’s First Class, not a student house party. Neither had any knowledge of the wines on the menu. Most of the food was awful. My steak was dry, over cooked and tough, and whichever catering manger signed off on a canapé of soggy mushroom on top of a chunk of polenta should be sacked immediately. I will say, the cheese and port were nice. However the worst thing was the constant galley noise. There was a cart stowage immediately in front of my seat (1K) which they were in and out of all night, and appeared incapable of shutting without slamming. They also seemed to have stored their personal belongings in to the bin immediately above my seat, so we’re in and out of that as well. I will say the seat itself is very well designed, but personally I’m happy in Club and would never do First again.  Flight took off two hours late after what can only be described as a shambles at the airport. No airbridge to the aircraft which is not acceptable. The aircraft was better than the outbound flight, who screen was so small. After serving only about 2/3rd of the cabin, no first choice. Only a vegetarian dish or a chicken dish from the economy cabin. The airline must know that vegetarians will order a meal, so why include it as a choice. Also, to offer a roll of ham/cheese for breakfast after a 12 hour flight is cost saving. A hot breakfast should be offered. With only 90 minutes between my connecting flight, due to late arrival, I made staff aware. Whilst they let me and others passengers of the flight first, there was no staff to assist in getting us to our flight. It was a struggle to get my connecting flight. On arriving in Glasgow, got txt to say my bags did not make the flight. First time using BA premium and likely my last.  British Airways continues to go downhill. We flew business class and the experience was like economy from 20 years ago except you can have a glass of champagne. We were packed in full 3x3 seats because of IT issue the day before. Even if weren’t, the Seat pitch and width is the same as economy. Gone are the little pretend tables in the middle seat to give some illusion of style. The food was dreadful. The in flight service was unsophisticated. BA used to have an acceptable European business class. They don’t any more. Other European airlines offer much better in flight experience in business class in comparison. BA is taking premium and frequent flyers for granted and treating us like mugs. How I miss the politeness of old BA business class from around 5 years ago, how I used to look forward to it, the small gestures like hanging up a coat, giving you a hot towel, having nice food, being served from the galley, rather than from the manky trolley. COVID is not the reason - this is years of cost cutting and the result is dreadful.  British Airways has scrapped the mandatory wearing of face masks onboard\\xa0flights, although they pretend publicly that the policy remains. BA454 from London to Malaga on 25th February, and across 6 visible rows around me there were 7 out of 24 passengers wearing face masks - and I was one of them. This was long after the meal / drinks service had been cleared, and remained like that as we landed and deplaned. Cabin crew were frequently up and down the aisles and not a word was said to any of these non compliant passengers, or as they left the aircraft with staff bidding them farewell. I guess they are too scared to remind people to follow the rules?\\xa0 Boarding was slow and uncomfortable on account of the lack air-con at the gate. The Club Suite cabins were about 3/4 full, but the rest of the plane can\\'t have been much more than 20% occupancy. Whether this is the reason why cabin crew on the flight were cut to the bare minimum is hard to say, but they certainly had to work hard covering multiple cabins. Despite that, the drink and food service in business was efficient, and the current policy of serving all courses at once meant that dinner was done and dusted two hours after take-off, which is a real bonus on a night-time flight. However, the quality of the food remains mediocre at best and the pasta dish was almost inedible. The Club Suite is a big improvement on the ancient CW product, although storage is a funny arrangement of tiny compartments that invite losing a smartphone or two. One definitely misses the drawer at foot level in old CW. The large screen really improves the viewing experience and the whole IFE system was much more responsive. The new seats don\\'t significantly aid sleeping, particularly as there\\'s an obvious ridge at the level of the base of the spine. Waking up two hours before touchdown is definitely to be recommended in order to get breakfast over and to avoid the usual queues for the toilets. Performance of the flight deck was up to its usual high standard and arrival was twenty minutes ahead of schedule. Progress through border control was speedy but baggage collection was delayed for unspecified reasons. Overall, a good flight. Over the past 2 years I have flown with British Airways twice and ended up in the exact same predicament of having to wait around all day in London Heathrow for a 1 hour flight home to Newcastle. While the holidays and the plane staff are fantastic the customer service and the staff at Heathrow are useless. First time in February 2020 I got stuck in Heathrow due to Storm Ciara when travelling home from work which was not the airlines fault. However the handling of the situation by the staff at the airport was a joke. They had 4 to 5 staff ran a kiosk queue of over 100+ unhappy travellers whilst they could have set up mini kiosks on the unused gates to get through everyone quicker. Their was no crowd control and at one point after queuing for 2 hours plus the staff decided to shut up shop. In the end after a 12 hour battle I was lucky enough to get home on the last flight of the day through sheer luck when I finally spoke to someone. In November 2021 I decided to give BA a second chance and booked to go to New York. Since the plane landed late into LHR I missed my connecting flight which could have been avoided if the staff at Heathrow had assisted me or held the plane for a short while. As I rushed through customs I did manage to make it to the gate with 5 minutes to spare and the plane still in the terminal but since they had taken my luggage off the flight they told me to go to the service desk and refused to let me on since they had moved me on to a later flight. My layover was now 10 hours and all I got from the guest services was a £12 food voucher to spend and a phone number for what I thought was complaints but after being on hold for 20 minutes found out it was not from complaints. Considering the fact this could have all been avoidable with more assistance to have only been given a food voucher for £12 seemed really cheap. A few days after I got home I then raised a complaint expressing how annoyed I was and waited over a month for a response before chasing it up only to find the complaints staff were not working. When I got a response I said I wanted 20-25% back off my holiday. I got an apology and told the staff at Heathrow will be better but in terms of good will and compensation I was offered nothing!   Return trip Cape Town to Durban in Club Class highlighted the inconsistency. Our outbound trip in December was good in all respects, whereas the return trip was disappointing. Check in was fine, apart from the agent failing to label one of bags priority, resulting in a long wait for our third bag. The lounge was busy, but no complaints. We went to the boarding gate at the check in time indicated on the screen, where there was no sign of activity, although the screen was still showing the same gate and departure time. Shortly thereafter two ground staff appeared and when approached said the flight was delayed from 1330 to 1410 and the gate was changed to the lower level bus gates. The informational screens had now updated to the delayed time and new gate. I checked on the flight radar app, which showed that our aircraft had started in Durban, and flown to Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, back to Cape Town, and it had been clear for some time that it had no hope of being on time for our flight. In fact looking at its schedule and turn around times it was always going to be late. Boarding eventually started at 1400 with departure at 1430, 60 minutes late. Drinks service only started 30 minutes later, followed by lunch. The food was good but the wine offering very mediocre, and not up to club standards. With the price of good wines in South Africa there is no excuse for serving poor wine. Lunch service was quick, but then the crew disappeared behind the curtain and there was no offering of top up drinks unless specifically requested. Overall this was a disappointing flight with a lacklustre crew  I recently had the unfortunate privilege of travelling on British Airways from Detroit to Bangalore and back. Given that it is a long and arduous journey with multiple layovers, I decided to spend extra and get a business class ticket. I was quickly dissuaded of any misconception that I was special because I spent that extra money or was in Business class. From shoddy service to rudeness and insolence from ground staff, I experienced nothing but frustration and insecurity throughout my journeys. The trump was being stranded in London having missed my connection and spending close to 3 hours to get to the front of the counter to rebook my flight. Being a business class traveller had no bearing as we were all told to stand in one gigantic line and wait our turn. Some special passengers were escorted to the Club World check in. When we asked the lady, she told us to continue standing where we were and she would come back to get us when the counter freed up. Needless to say it never did. Finally got my turn with no extra help from any of the ground staff that was running around in a frenzy and was rebooked. So I come back to the question: Can big corporations lie with no accountability? Why would I spend my hard-earned money on something that gave me nothing extra? Shame on you British Airways for your complete disregard for your passengers. Stop your lying or update your promises!  The entertainment selection was sub par, minimal selections and the new releases were  not new releases. My food left something to be desired. Two of the seats in our row the earphone jack didn’t work. The plane was either uncomfortably hot or too cold, find a medium temp. Just overall a very basic generic airline. On arrival at the Warsaw Airport the check in zone was the only one that was not announced on the flight board - we had to guess and ask random people where to go. Once we finally found the check-in desks, luggage drop and check-in was appalling. It took us over 1.5 hours to get our bags checked (and we were half way through the queue). The whole process was disorganised and very slow, really the last thing you want when looking after 2 small, impatient kids. Lady in Warsaw Airport who was supposed to direct passengers to the correct queue was useless. One check-in desk for Euro Traveller / Club Europe, one for bag drop and one for the check-in.  Flight left delayed but the pilots managed to catch up and landed with a small delay, crew on the plane was nice and attentive. Luckily the in air experience was much better, but sort out your ground service at Warsaw Airport. After two years of being unable to fly to our second home in South Africa because of COVID, it was fantastic to be back on board a BA flight to CPT, and in the Club Suite seats (1K and 2K) to boot. These seats are a huge improvement on the old yin-yang CW seats in terms of privacy, ease of access and the IFE screen, but the cabin still felt densely occupied and the seats were just as uncomfortable when lying flat. Storage was a mixed blessing, too, with three rather fussy little compartments rather than the decent sized drawer in the old CW, meaning that a laptop would have to be stored above. The food onboard was woeful, although serving all three courses at the same time does at least mean that the dinner service isn\\'t dragged out. Cabin crew went about their business dutifully but with little enthusiasm, and there were the usual queues for the toilets. The flight itself was uneventful and landing was more or less on time. CPT had an efficient arrangement for checking forms immediately after leaving the airbridge and there were no queues at immigration. It was good to be back!  I paid $1189 for a round trip flight to London and back in premium economy. They bumped me from the seat for the flight back, and told me I\\'d be issued a refund. Instead of being issued a refund I had to contact them through several different methods, phone, website, Twitter, and finally email. They told me I\\'d be getting $229.16 back, which is less than half of the $589 I paid for the upgrade. Instead they refunded $14.58. I emailed again and they told me I\\'d be getting $115.16 more back. When I emailed again saying that that doesn\\'t add up to the original amount I was told I was getting they simply replied with \"That\\'s the final amount.\" Turns out that meant they were taking back the initial refund of $14.58 and I was only getting $115.16 total. So I emailed them again asking why they changed the amount and they\\'ve yet to respond. So I called this morning and after explaining politely what I was calling for they hung up on me.  First of this was one of the smoothest UK to US flights I have taken. The boarding was appalling and had families with kids queue for no reason at all. They called families to the front but then decided to board business and premier classes first which I appreciate why but why call families? The worse seats ever and the legroom was appalling. The entertainment system is basic, it does not support Bluetooth headphones, the USB does not support your own devices for movies although the website says yes and the headphones input was as good as useless.  The crew were nice so sorry I missed that.  Check-in very slow. No app check-in and could not check my vaccine QR code online. Check in staff friendly but too few of them. BA Silver card holder and no Stockholm lounge  to use. Boarding fine, but plane was worn out. Seats close together and row 30 even worse.  Crew really professional and happy it seemed. Arrival at Heathrow a total shambles. BA777 landed at 12.50, no gate so waited and waited for 25 minutes. Then BA jetty didn’t work. Then BA had no steps. Very slow to leave plane as only moderately mobile wheelchair passengers struggle down the steps. Everyone was very patient and supportive but it was terrible to watch. So BA skimping on lounge, plane condition and gate. Crew good, seats very uncomfortable.  This whole experience was sickening, over 3.5 grand spent on the holiday and their customer service is a shambles. Drop down menu to drop down menu not stating what I wanted to complain about. Would not even allow me to add tier points. The flight to London was marred with problems. In London we received an upgrade email to fast track and VIP lounges due to amount spent. This never happened and treated as paupers wherever we showed the email. We had to change planes to the other side of the airfield. The resort (Riu Paradise Beach) was riddled with bad food, drugs and bad attitude and when you complained you were fobbed off as they knew there was no BA staff to sound off too. The return journey was a shambles and more delays finally arriving back at Manchester completely exhausted and needing another holiday. There is light at the end of this horrid tunnel Virgin Atlantic have just started the same route from this month. Now we all know this is a better option.  Poorly mismanaged services this time. Disappointed with the huge queues due to unavailability of attendants at the counters, had to wait around 1.5 hours just to check in. Then came the boarding, again had to wait at the passage for 15-30 mins. Finally when we thought things are better now, on reaching London our next boarding pass was not scanned. Around 15-20 passengers including me had to wait from 7.45 am until 1.40 am for the next flight. On boarding the next flight, no space to keep the luggage. Journey was really hectic and did not expect this from BA.  I booked and paid for what I thought was a business class seat on a flight to Athens. What I got was a premium economy seat. The first nine rows were business class seats, rows 10 to 16 were what should have been the premium economy cabin (but had been added to the business class section) which had less comfortable seats that didn’t fully recline, unlike the seats in rows 1 to 9 (I was in row 11). This is not a case of me being snobby, but simply a point of principle and a clear case of BA mis-selling. Had I known prior that I would be paying the same business class price but for seats that were less comfortable than other business class passengers on the same flight, I wouldn’t have booked. I complained on board along with several other passengers who also resented being scammed in that way. I also made a formal complaint to BA but was fobbed off. Apparently this is a long running scam, I don’t know how they get away with it. This was my first flight during the pandemic, so it was understandable the difficulties facing airlines. Check-in was longer than normal due to the vaccine checks and passenger locator forms etc. But on the return flight, it was a total mess. Just two counters open for economy and one for business. There were arguments regarding vaccine checks, where two BA staff were contradicting each other. It took an hour and ten minutes just to check in, resulting in the flight delay. On board, I was not expecting great service.  Seating was extremely uncomfortable, 29 inch pitch and 17 inch wide seats - just about bearable for an hour and a half flight.  On board service was a packet of crisps and a small bottle of water from another, no eye contact with me just handed out. However, I was pleased that disembarking passengers were let out in groups, despite a few idiots who decided to stand a up to get their hand luggage out while the aircraft is was still taxing to the gate. The cabin crew did manage to force them back to their seats and close the lockers.  We have flown with BA for many years and never will again where there is an alternative. Booked and paid for Club class flights. Didn\\'t receive a meal or drinks onboard, crew were so unorganised. We were delayed on the ground for 30 minutes prior to departing so they had plenty of time to prepare but the in-flight service was delayed once up in the air. They commenced the service, albeit very slowly, then abandoned it and closed the service altogether. The crew never even had the decency to speak to us to apologise in person or even over the tannoy.  Complained to BA and received an apology by email with the usual \"we fell short of our standards\" generic speech, but no offer of any partial refund or Avios to compensate for the lack of service.   I’ve had to book six flights with BA recently. All have either been cancelled or had a significant time change. The latest flight was so late into Heathrow we missed our connecting flight even though we’d scheduled around 2 hours between flights. BA staff at Heathrow were rude and generally clueless for the most part. They couldn’t get us to our destination within 24 hours of our scheduled arrival time. We booked an easyJet flight from Gatwick instead and had to pay to get ourselves to Gatwick. A complaint was registered several weeks ago with no response so far. Perhaps BA have a backlog of complaints the way they are performing at the moment. It’s an embarrassment that our national flag carrier is being comfortably out performed by budget airlines but that appears to be the case at the moment. Such terrible service in Club World. Such indifference and lackadaisical attitude. Hardly any service. Everything has to be asked for and gotten. Asked for a cup of tea and had the flight say..\\'whaa\\' and then when I said cup of tea she said yes...asked if wanted milk and sugar. Brought to me lukewarm tea with 2 sugar sachets, no spoon or stirrer. Pushed the bell for stirrer and had to wait a full 3 mins before someone came by, eventually for a spoon and had to drink cold tea. Seriously BA...what are you doing? Is this how you welcome back people to fly? No check in staff for Economy. Never experienced this before. While Business passengers strolled up, Economy passengers were left standing for 90 mins plus.  I think British Airways needs to be much clearer about what their Covid-19 \"travel flexibility\" really means, because it doesn\\'t pass the common-sense test: I purchased a round-trip business class ticket from New York to-and-from Mykonos through London. I traveled there with no problem. The day before my return to New York, though, I took my Covid-19 test and learned that I tested positive. I tried to call the airline on the many usless numbers they provide on their website. The recorded message drones on and on about how they have no one to answer the phone because of Covid safety and simply says \"therefore we can\\'t answer your call; try again.\" No ability to leave a call-back number or a voicemail, etc. For whatever reason the BA website thought that I had bought the ticket through a third-party agent (I did not - I bought it on BA.com) and so wouldnt let me cancel or reschedule the flight on the web site. I called and called over the coming days and could not get through to the London, Athens or New York lines. Two days later after having 2 negative PCR tests (the most accurate test), I learned I was not positive and so had to buy a new $5000 return flight to the U.S. I\\'ve now been calling the BA USA customer service line for nearly a month at least every other day, never to get through. Finally did and have been told that the fact that I couldnt get on the flight because of a COVID scare counts for nothing. The fact they dont have enough people answering the phone counts for nothing. Or that I was unable to change the flight to a few days later on the web site becuase the ticket was mis-booked. They have offered that if I send them a Greek doctor\\'s note saying that I was sick, then they\\'ll give me a voucher for a future flight from Mykonos to New York. I am speechless at the stupidity of this whole situation.   They cancelled a flight I booked three months ago for some operational problem at a time where the prices are off the roof. British Airways could not give me any alternatives other than refund or a voucher.   I usually avoid BA because of its appalling customer service and sneaky extra charges, but this flight was my only option. Note that BA actually charges for seat pre-selection in biz class -- 100 UK pounds in this case! Does any other airline in the world dare do that? I saved the money and waited until checkin to choose my seat for free. The seats were BA\\'s universally derided, cramped 6-across back-to-front configuration, where you stare into the face of your seat mate an arm\\'s length away. No other airline ever came up with this awkward arrangement --- I wonder why? No preflight drink was offered. At meal time I selected one of the three main offerings, only to be told it wasn\\'t available -- even though there were only 3 people in my 16 seat biz section. The seat area has practically no storage except a tiny drawer at ankle level that is inaccessible when the seat is in lie flat position. The \"bed\" is the narrowest I have experienced in biz class, and is also very hard. The cabin was very cold and the blanket very thin; I had to raid blankets from two other seats just to stay warm. The amenity kit is the smallest I\\'ve ever seen in biz class -- it fits in the palm of the hand. All in all, this uncomfortable, miserly experience is hardly worth the £5,727 that BA charges for this route. I used miles to pay for my ticket -- but of course got whacked with BA\\'s unique and notorious \"fuel surcharge\" fee of $636 for using miles.  I want to say a big thank you to Kahina Ladjouze. After frustratingly missing my flight due to M25 road closures, she helped me secure and book the next day flight without additional charges. I am really grateful.  I was deeply unimpressed with the lack of social distancing on my flight. The plane to London was 90% or more full, and no social distancing could be applied. A number of people wearing face masks incorrectly (over mouth or as a chinstrap) throughout the flight, and there was a fair amount of time when masks were off for the free snack (small bag of crisps and 250ml of water).  It seems crazy to allow a considerate amount of time with masks off or inappropriately worn in such a small space with no safe distance whatsoever. Also, only the absolute minimum of service which, given COVID, is understandable but makes the flight really boring - or not, since some excitement was provided by turbulence, with very little information from the flight deck. Disembarkation was chaotic to say the least but Terminal 5 was empty and vast enough to allow to finally distance. An upgrade for 89 Euros one was was available but it didn\\'t seem to make sense. At least they departed on time and the plane appeared reasonably clean.  London to Frankfurt. I made the mistake of exchanging my April flights with BA for a voucher, because of the travel disruption due to the pandemic. Big mistake. BA has failed completely and does not seem to care. I tried to book an August flight using the voucher, but frlights cannot be booked online using a voucher. You have to wait for hours on the phone to speak to someone. Customer service tried to charge me twice the original cost. Then no email confirmation for hours, after I chased it up (another long wait on hold). Email confirmation showed they had booked the wrong outbound date - service supervisor denied any error on their part and refused to rebook for correct date or give a refund. A few days later I started all over again and booked an alternative outbound date (still not the one I wanted, but better) - And 3 weeks later, BA cancelled the return flight! So I Called for a refund to be told \"If it hasn\\'t appeared in my account after 21 days, to get back in touch\".  Things go wrong. It\\'s how you deal with problems that mark out good customer service. BA hasn\\'t a clue!  Total rip off. British Airways cancels flights due to Pandemic Covid 19. When i use the voucher they issued me they want me to pay a additional $1000 for a first class seat. British Airways way to rip people off and profit from a world pandemic.   Tokyo to London. 12 hours without anything to eat because the sandwich I was given was inedible. There was no bar service and soft drinks were pitiful with orange running out after a matter of hours. Total waste of money having paid for Premium Economy. I am aware it was the beginning of the Covid19 issues but the situation was appalling and has been made worse by a total lack of follow up service from British Airways. Their attitude is unacceptable - it is all about money with them.   At check-in desk at T5 Heathrow was told by BA staff that Sweden only allowing Swedish nationals into country. This was contrary to advice on Swedish Government website.  I rang the border control office at Arlanda airport. They confirmed that EU/EFTA/EEA & UK nationals were clear to enter the country. I offered the phone to BA staff to clear up any confusion. They declined and then changed their story saying it was their own company policy. I spent the next hour trying to get through to BA on the telephone for a refund. The calls were being disconnect due to high call volumes.  BA standard of service compared to the other major European airlines was dishonest and obstructive. Furthermore if the other airlines can provide customer support on the telephone or via email at this time BA should be able to do the same. While in-flight staff at BA are still terrific, they are let down by the worst sort of management bureaucracy. Paris to London. Flight cancelled due to “ATC Restrictions” after Storm Ciara  and rebooked to a later flight which was delayed on top by 2 hours. Arrived in London 6 hours later than planned initially and BA refused to recognise any additional expenses because it was a forceful operational reason. Booked 3 flights to Italy for March, all cancelled. Last Thursday booked LGW/BGY/LGW and next day cancelled (for last week of March) a month away. Been a Gold Member of BA since 2016 and after seeing their constant downgrades, I will go back with AirFrance/KLM for my travel needs. AI found thr food and seats on Euro Business a shame.  I flew from Sydney to London to visit my seriously ill mother. The second leg, from Singapore to London was with British Airways. My return flight from London to Sydney was with British Airways, leaving 23 February. On 20 February it became clear that Mum did not have long to live. I contacted BA, who said I should be able to change my return date, and asked me to send medical documentation, which I did, with an explanatory email. Sadly Mum passed away very early on the morning of 22 February. I contacted BA again the next day. They said because I had booked through Webjet, I needed to contact them. I phoned them, they said they would contact BA. No follow up from either. When I phoned Webjet again, they said still no word from BA. When I phoned BA again, they said they couldn\\'t help. At this point I gave up and booked with Qantas, paying for another flight. BA\\'s complete lack of compassion (apart from a couple of platitudes), and lack of interest in helping me in any way, astounded me. Needless to say, I will never use British Airways again.  Johannesburg to Dublin via London. I get to the counter and require a transit visa. Since when and why if you are in the same terminal even. There was no support, guidance or remorse from the staff. I also had a non refundable hotel booking in Dublin! BA need to communicate such changes.  BA cancelled my return flight on 09-Feb-20 from Geneva to Gatwick due to storm Ciara. They rebooked me onto a later flight, then cancelled that as well. Since then, I heard nothing more and I was left on my own to buy a new return flight. I\\'ve tried calling them several times every day, but they are not answering their phones, claiming they are too busy to talk to customers. They cancelled my flight, so I want a refund, but so far there is no way of getting through to them.   Madrid to London. I keep giving BA the benefit of the doubt, but things are getting worse not better. This A321 has cramped business class seats, no middle table any more and frankly this is a pathetic premium cabin. Despite every statement they make about catering improvements, i simply refer to meal photos on this route in 2016 or 2017 to see they have severely cut back on meal portions and cost. Iberia staff in  Madrid were all very nice, cabin staff okay, but overall Club Europe is not worth the money - don\\'t waste your money on this.    Las Vegas to Gatwick. A very disappointing service for Club World, it felt like I was travelling in economy (with attitude). Especially considering the very high cost of the flight (I\\'ve paid half as much less for business class returns to Australia). We got off to a bad start when offered one third of a glass of champagne (about 2 cm in the bottom of the glass). My initial drink after take off was not what I ordered, when I queried it, I got a lecture on this was how it should be. No wine arrived with dinner, until I asked for it a second time (out of stock of the first choice), no second glass of wine offered. Yes, I could have used the call button, but 1/3 of a glass of champagne and one glass of wine being offered on a 10 hour business class flight? Other than the initial bottle of water, and a glass of water with dinner, no other water was offered until I got up and went to the galley to ask. The good news is the food was good and well presented. Although the promised (on the menu) selection of pastries with breakfast were not served (I later walked past the galley to see the crew eating them for their own breakfast). We had dutifully filled in the pre-order card for breakfast, only to find we were being asked again at breakfast. Sleeping was impossible due to the temperature being so high, I actually thought I had a fever (I was so drenched in sweat) until I spoke to a colleague who was the same. I\\'m used to flying ultra long haul with Middle Eastern airlines, so I\\'m used to hot cabins, but this was crazy. Only when the crew dropped the temperature a few hours before landing (presumably to wake us up), was it bearable enough to sleep. Combined with the a very dry cabin air, it was very unpleasant. No need to say anything much about the eight across seating as I know the seats are being upgraded over the next few years, other than they are very cramped if sitting next to a window. I do like the semi-reclined position for take off and landing though. I have fairly big shoulders and found the seat width very restrictive. There is nowhere to put your spectacles or bottles of water if lying down. Being on the second aisle, we had to join in with the economy passengers queuing to disembark, so it wasn\\'t quick. At no point did any member of the cabin crew introduce themselves other than via a general PA announcement. The seats I can forgive as they are being addressed, but the service was budget airline level. Really BA, you need to do much, much better. The ground staff in Las Vegas were fast, friendly and efficient. The lounge was something from the dark ages, all 1970\\'s wooden panels. London Heathrow to Bangkok. Done this route a few times with British Airways over the years, first time and probably last in economy, old plane needs upgrade, poor entertainment system. Uncomfortable seats especially for 10+ hour flight. I know they’re starting to upgrade these planes but still a long time away. The only saving grace was a superb cabin staff in economy.  London to Los Angeles. Take off was delayed by 3 hrs (which we spent onboard) because of a dent to the door which needed inspection - sure maybe outside of their control. I was flying with my wife and two kids (2 & 4), sitting on bulkhead with 3 seats and using the baby bassinet facility. After take off we saw that the inflight entertainment service (for the whole section - not whole cabin) was not working. And we were sitting into an 11.5hr overnight flight with two little ones, meaning sleeping was not going to happen. We contacted the cabin crew who made zero accommodation. Sorry they said. During the flight the cabin crew stood in the galley behind the bulkhead talking loudly while the lights were dimmed, and kept slamming drawers as they moved things around. To cap it off, we landed at 10pm ET and they had left behind our baby car seat and stroller. We finally received them back 2 days later. Conclusion, never fly BA again.  British Airways (Comair) Johannesburg to Cape Town route is never less than fully subscribed, and on this occasion the equivalent of Club Europe stretched back 9 rows. Service followed the usual pattern of a drink (champagne included) and Comair’s idiosyncratic ‘four-course meal’, I.e. a tiny salad, a hot course that one could see before choosing, a minute iced cake and a minuscule cheese & biscuits. The hot meal is invariably scorched around the edges. Comair really need to move with the times to a more modern business class offering. Aside from the meal, the flight was typically efficient, with arrival slightly ahead of schedule.  Fly economy and you’ll be paying more for an awful service. The London to Vancouver route uses old planes, the oldest inflight entertainment systems and my food was inedible.  My partner and I spent Christmas in Tokyo. The flight over was enjoyable the staff were polite and helpful and it all ran smoothly. Our experience back home was completely different. The staff were incredibly rude and lazy. The flight was 12 hours and mid flight my partner asked for a bottle of water. The lady very rudely said she was going the other way and that my partner could head to the back and help herself. My partner headed to the back where there were two more ladies sitting and when requested they pointed to a shelf my partner got the water from. Both our TV\\'s stopped working mid flight also for a period of 40 minutes. We asked the staff if they could fix the problem. The lady said she would try while sighing. As 25 year olds deciding on which airline brands to remain loyal to I can tell you British Airways will not be it. Terrible customer service.  Los Angeles to London Heathrow. If I could give BA a zero stars I would. They have the worst customer service. I’ve flown many airlines around the world with my family, but surely we will never fly with British Airways again. They gave our seats away on the return flight and would not address this after purchasing expensive business class tickets 4.5 months in advance to ensure that our family flew 12 hour flight together. The flight to London didn’t have the best service, most toilets were out of service. The beds in business class are the most uncomfortable of all business class I’ve flown. The check-in process at Heathrow was disastrous. The most inefficient process with no human assistances. The limited ones available were all slammed with line of customers. I would highly suggest you refrain from using this carrier. I wish I would have done a bit of research prior to flying with them.  New York to London. I was on the last flight out at 11.35 pm and this is clearly the cheaper version in all respects.  The Boeing 777 certainly showed its age. IFE screen was tiny, seat was well used. The flight time was quick (5.50 hours) and thats about it. FA is highly professional to the point of being unfriendly to me. The F& B was standard and not taken as I had eaten something earlier. I\\'m a One World Emerald and the cabin manager did not greet me. Its a small touch and in the grand scheme of things means little but is an acknowledgement that you spend time and money with that carrier (usually followed by a drink or two).   Austin to London. Along with an $1900 purchase price for each of two roundtrip tickets for my wife and daughter, BA charged an additional $250 for seat reservations to ensure they sat together. When they went to check in, those seat reservations (in both directions) had been given away and family had to sit in different seats. Back home, I applied for a refund of the $250 seat fee and was told there was no proof I paid for them. I have credit card charges and email confirmations clearly stating these charges were made, but there is no process to upload those documents to BA.  Heathrow to Belfast. Great service in Belfast but absolutely shocking in T5 at Heathrow. Very rude check in staff when told we had to print out boarding passes and also for our suitcases. Totally disgusted. Cabin crew were lovely on the 12.40 flight to Belfast on 9th December.  Johannesburg to London. The recently refurbished First and Club World lounge at JNB has failed to resolve the congestion when passengers from the two evening flights to LHR descend on it. There\\'s more table space for eating and the food has improved, but poor acoustics mean intrusion on privacy. Crying babies and facetime calls add to the restless maelstrom of human activity. Boarding was reasonably quick although there was the usual confusion about group queues. The predominantly young, mixed fleet crew were competent but lacked finesse and kept on getting drinks orders muddled. The meal service took ages because of some unidentified problem with heating the main course. The food itself wasn\\'t at all bad - when it was finally served. The cabin temperature wasn\\'t too hot and we both slept quite well. Arrival was ten minutes ahead of schedule and baggage collection was quick. Overall, a good flight despite the aged Club World product.  San Francisco to Oslo via London. The head support was damaged, so I had to sit 10 hours leaned forward. The flight from San Francisco was delayed, so I missed my connecting flight in London to Oslo. I came first to the BA counter, but received a new flight 3 hours 15 minutes later. Rude staff gave me a voucher for 15 GBP.  London to Sydney via Singapore. I would like to express my thanks and appreciation to the staff at the bag drop centre at Heathrow when I lost my passport on Thursday evening -21st November. They spent nearly 2 hours trying to locate it and it was eventually found 30 mins before my flight was due to leave. A big thank you to you all. I would also like to thank the cabin crew on flight BA0015-Singapore to Sydney -22 November who were so kind after I was taken ill during the flight, I was looked after so well.  Lisbon to London. I pay extra to check my bag, to ensure I am not using more than my share of overhead space. To have British Airways charge me 50 Euros to check a bag to my final destination, and then insist that my briefcase be put under the seat, in a cramped aircraft, to ensure there is room in the overhead bin for travelers too cheap to check their bags, is an insult. Will never fly BA again.  BA operate daily shuttles from London to Glasgow, its a busy route and I\\'m sure make money plus there is no competition. However, BA flights are rarely on time and the fee paying passenger\\'s are fed stories about the aircraft was delayed en-route from some far flung exotic location. Because I have several buses and trains to catch after I reach Glasgow punctuality means a lot to me and not a lot to BA hence I\\'m very disappointed with the service they provide.  London to Vancouver. I used to fly this aircraft and route for many years until it was no longer priced competitively. I flew on the 14th and it was a remarkably bad experience. Food service was very poor in most aspects. I had the chicken tandoori which was far too spicy for most palettes. No drink was offered with the meal which was astonishing. Rather, tea and coffee an obviously far cheaper offering was supplied soon after the dinner tray was handed. I had to ask twice for a beer before it was delivered.This then put me out of sync with the service. The one time (yes one time!) offer of tea and coffee was then obviously missed by me completely. Service itself was not good with no warmth or hospitality. On a 9hr flight engagement is pretty critical! Our hostess/host seemed to be only interested in those sitting in the extra legroom seats and essentially ignored everyone else. The cold snack was a cold tasteless sandwich just prior to landing. The entertainment system is a joke as it is so old. I had become so accustomed to a normal/newish TV screen that I was blown away that this system was still in place. The screen size was the equivalent of your phone’s. No music selection worth talking about so I just used my iPad. On this or similar routes I have flown Air Canada, WestJet, Virgin Atlantic, Air Transat. BA was by far the worst and some of those airlines are budget in nature and offer paid meals only. I cannot believe that the mighty BA offers such a terrible product in 2019. I will spend more to fly better and actively avoid BA on long haul. The flight departure was delayed due to what the Captain described in his announcement as a \"mix up\" with paperwork. Disembarkation was delayed due to what he also described as a \"mix up\" with landing bridge allocation. So the plane had to taxi around the runway until a gate was found. We missed our connecting flight. The staff in purple at the airport who are supposed to help passengers find connecting flights didn’t know what to do. We ended up being shunted onto another flight resulting in a four hour delay. All of this inconvenience is due to BA’s incompetent management. My seat would not recline and the food was just carbohydrate filigree. The flight attendants are rude. It used to be a good airline.  London to San Francisco return in Economy. The seats are small. Outbound was bearable because there was an empty seat between the two of us but returning no empty seat and it was horrible. I\\'m only 5\\'5 and female but couldn\\'t lean down to the seat in front of me to collect my belongings. If you want to get anything from your bag below the seat in front of you, you will need to do some major maneuvering. Touching the person next to you throughout the flight is unavoidable. I flew on a 747 both ways. They no longer have any air vents you can adjust so both flights got stuffy and warm. I had to ask them to turn up the a/c both ways. I was literally sweating. Economy is small with the aircraft mostly made up of Business Class. Asian Vegetarian meal was good as usual although the breakfast was terrible. Asian Vegetarian breakfast in Economy Plus is much better. I will find an alternative airline for my long haul flights. It\\'s not worth it.  Zurich to London return. Both legs travelled with hand luggage only, and I could not choose a seat without paying. Fair enough but when there are 3 empty rows either side of 3 strangers cramped into one row and not allowed spread out as they had not paid the premium price seems mean to say the least. Hand Luggage fares are last to board, make them uncomfortable on board, no free food nor drink. London to Malaga. A terminally ill airline packed with clueless staff full of attitude. At the checking at Gatwick airport, I was told the flight might well be delayed of 2h as not departed yet from Malaga. SMS confirmed the delay without a new time of departure and provided a link for flight status. At Gatwick, there are no arrival/departure boards prior to security for me to check if the flight was on time as shown online. When asked the BA guy at the lounge kiosk, he said I could check the link provided or go through security where monitors are. Surprisingly the flight was on time and no text was sent for an update. At the gate, we were told the aircraft was replaced. No apologies from anyone neither ground nor on the flight. We boarded at 5 pm and took off at 18:15. Stiff and no recliner seats. Cabin crew are so sociopathic and full of attitudes. 6 additional seats are replacing the 2 toilets located at the back of the 320 and located at the very far end of the aircraft in the cabin crew storage room and working space is. Horrible low cost service for a flag carrier ticket price.  Buenos Aires to London Heathrow rwturn. The aircraft is very old, cabin configuration is very old and tired. IFE screens have not been changed since they were first installed. My Ipod has a larger and more responsive screen. Before taking off in Buenos Aires, some pax, but not all, were offered water or orange juice. I never got any. After take off, drinks were offered, followed by a hot meal. Food choices ran out in the first row. Seats were uncomfortable, footrests were jammed. On the return flight, sparkling wine and water were offered before take off, followed by drinks and the meal I had chosen online was a beef stew with mashed potatoes. Poor movie choices, miniature screen and uncomfortable seats. Crew OK. No indication as to which toilets to use, either forward in business class or rear economy. Having flown Norwegian on their B787 in their premium cabin on the same route, BA is a waste of my money.   Johannesburg to Amsterdam via London. After many delayed departures they announced that the flight was cancelled and rescheduled to depart the following night at 8pm. The following night at 7.30 pm they announced further delays due to the same \"technical\" fault reported 24 hours previously. Finally departed at 10pm, consequences were missed connecting flight to Amsterdam. WE also had to pay for our \"no show\" at our hotel in Amsterdam and when trying to claim this charge from BA they declined but offered to pay for our taxi? Arrived in Amsterdam 30 hours later. What really annoyed us was the lack of communication and disorganized manner on how the events were mishandled. Once on board the crew were really nice and just as we were getting new hope this was shattered by the terrible food and on board entertainment that was outdated. Our connecting BA flight back home was the same thing and on arrival we were delayed on disembarking.  One of the reasons we traveled club class was because BA have lounges where you can get away from the usual airport chaos and screaming children. BA don’t tell you there is no lounge at Kos airport. Limited seating. Very noisy limited facilities. Not sure I will spend so much on air tickets with them in the future if they don’t warn of limited facilities. It doesn’t help that the flight is delayed by an hour! The start of our journey back from from EFL was inauspicious, with hundreds of delayed and stranded passengers crammed into the departure lounge, awaiting flights on airlines other than BA. As it was, weather in the UK plus air traffic control issues meant that departure was delayed by 90 minutes. Once airborne in a refitted A320 (complete with a nice fresh leather smell!), cabin crew in CE were friendly and efficient, and the food (including a cod dish) was quite reasonable. It was interesting to note that the refit hadn\\'t extended to the toilet which was looking distinctly worse for the wear. A big plus on the flight - and a first for me - was WiFi, which actually worked and was quite fast - although at a cost of £4.99 for an hour\\'s use. I thought it was meant to be free for business class passengers, but evidently not. Landing made up for some time but we were parked right in the middle of nowhere because of a backlog of flights. However, BA had laid on a separate bus for CE passengers and we were out of the airport 30 minutes later. So, not too bad, all in all. Chicago to Zurich via London. Delays after delays. The flight was supposed to depart at 8:30 pm (Chicago Time) but was scheduled at 9:40 pm, we waited a long time at the airport. Finally, at 10 pm we managed to board on the A380 for my first time but the legroom was horrible. The IFE completely unfunctional and with no food served. During the taxi, a technical problem occurred and we returned to the gate. In the end, the plane took off at 12 am Chicago time and we arrived in London Heathrow at 2 pm. We had to wait 3 hours for boarding for another 30 minutes delayed flight. We arrived in Zurich on an old A319 at 9:30 pm Zurich time instead of the original 3:30 pm. Very stressful at least the staff were nice.  I wouldn\\'t even rate them 1/10 2 x business class passengers booked via On Business. 1 bag lost in transit. Ground crew in MXP rude, dismissive & most unhelpful, unable to locate missing bag. Waited for next flight to arrive, still no bag. Decided to cut short our trip as the bag contained essential meds - ok that\\'s a lesson learnt the hard way. Due to this being an OB booking BA customer services unwilling to be flexible and change tickets resulting in full fare tickets purchased to return. Apparently the bag arrived 24hrs later, we were back in the UK, despite BA website showing in transit LHR/MXP for 8 days! Numerous lengthy calls to customer service proved fruitless, passed from one department to another then cut off! After an email to their CEO & Director of Brand and Customer Experience received a call from Global Engagement Executive Team offering £100 e-voucher. Abysmal customer services. No wonder their reputation is in tatters. I will never fly BA again.  Hong Kong to London. An email on the 25th August advising us that this flight was cancelled and the hours spent on hold never speaking to anyone, what a total awful nightmare. Then the email at 6.00pm saying I must be delighted to find out my flight has not been cancelled. All slots in the Elemis Salon were already booked so no massages were available in First Class. Arriving at HK airport on the return journey and struggling even to get from the pavement to the inside of the terminal (why did they not tell us to print out proof of travel??). We had to wait ages for BA to open a check in desk, pretty average food and service in the Qantas lounge. A broken screen in seat 59A (it would not stay in position and without wedging, unusable to constant interruptions during the flight to my partner from a large passenger climbing over him. A ghastly sweet and sour chicken main course which made me send my tray away and not eat until after leaving the flight. Cheapest goodies bag with the broken zip and my suitcase was the very last off the plane. I had already been to the BA desk and reported it when it then eventually turned up on the conveyor belt. First class out to HK was a good business class experience, the return flight in business class was in a word poor. The plane was tired, IFE faulty, poor food and the journey was only saved by the quality of the staff, they were lovely - but if you give them rubbish tools they will serve rubbish. The night term pantry offering was a total joke. I have been a BA Exec card holder since for ever and I have seen is a decline in the service level. Certainly not value for money, we did not get a Club class experience on the flight home.  Gatwick to Seville. When my son and his girlfriend proceeded to drop their hand luggage a member of staff insisted in making them pay 50GBP because one of the suitcases was 4cm oversize, and he insisted that it was not a hand luggage. Staff said that if he did not pay, he would lose the flight. Mahe to Stockholm via London. Checked in online before the flight but had to do the bag drop. Was met by a rude lady at First class check in and the process took about 20 minutes, don’t know why, no apology. The boarding was in time. The welcome wasn’t especially friendly, just pointing the direction where to go. The club Europe cabin felt claustrophobic, I had a window seat. The CSM never came to say hello. The service was pretty basic, ok during the meals but self service between. No drink service if you didn’t ask. On the flight to Stockholm the purser introduced himself to all emerald members. The service was limited due to the strike next day but friendly. The seating was terrible on this A320, so tight. I have to say travelling in Club Europe is a waste of money. The food was no better than economy food from the past. The seats are just the same as in economy although you get a middle tray, and probably worst of all the cabin was full of a lot of arrogant people who thought that just because they were not in economy it somehow made them more worthy people. This might be a British trait as I’ve travelled business class on other airlines and not had the same experience.  London to Glasgow. BA customer service is unquestionably the least helpful, least accommodating, least friendly and least responsive so called service available. They clearly train their staff in the multitude of ways to frustrate their customers. I will try to avoid this airline from this point on.   British Airways flight to Brussels from Heathrow. Check in problems and a hugely delayed flight. Pay premium prices for a below average service. They need to invest in their IT systems and greatly up their game.  London City to Ibiza. Disappointing. All the flights were cancelled without explanation - presumably because the striking staff didn\\'t turn up, so trip was ruined. Got a replacement ticket for a different destination on a different week. Trip was basic. The meal consisted of two small shortbread biscuits. British Airways is now firmly in the bucket airlines, easily beaten by Easyjet  Calgary to London. Staff were not in high standards. Looked rushed and not polite, did not look professional enough. In our flight back to London staff were laughed and just chilled very loudly in back of the aircraft. There was not welcome snacks. We sat in the very last row and food choice ended. Only chicken was our option to have. Very sad and staff did not care about this situation.  What happened to a great airline? Got to Heathrow 1.5 hours before flight and start queuing and at one point there were only 2 operators and then after 15 minutes a 3rd appeared. 45 minutes later a BA guy asks for Vegas travellers and then asks us to go toba different line to rush things through. There was 1 operator on this line and it took another 20 minutes? Waited over 1 hour on the tarmac as we has missed our slot due to late boarding. Got to Las Vegas and waited at baggage claim for over 40 minutes, no bag. Got to BA desk to be told luggage missed plane and there should have been 2 members of staff at bag claim to tell us. No apology just a shrug of shoulders. During day receive offers from BA to upgrade to Club class and I try at least 10 times to book but website does not process. Speak to BA at 1st offer to be told offer finished despite the web advertising, get through to Manager who admits the BA website is the worst and advises to keep trying. Book in online for return and web accepts the 2 bags stated on web as 0 bags. Ring BA and they say go to airport and speak to a member of staff. Get Vegas 3 hours early to make sure plenty of time to sort and find out there are NO BA staff available in the whole airport until 2 hours before flight. What a useless organisation. I must state staff on plane very good. Heathrow to Marseille. Within a few days of booking a flight for December, BA advised flight has been changed to late evening arrival. This is unacceptable so I opt to cancel and full refund. BA then says it is refunding the fare and makes no mention of the fee I have paid for seat selection. I have found a claim form for refund of these fees, on submission they say they will take up to 28 days to think about it.  Frankfurt to London. BA staff watched while security went through partner\\'s bag for around 30 mins. It required a call to police who sauntered up and stared at the bag for a while - actually just clothes. When they were finishing the flight dispatcher closed the flight. Only 1-2 minutes required. Much longer spent unloading my luggage. We had checked this bag in almost 2 hours previously and arrived at security in plenty of time. ❎ London to Olbia. Complete confusion. The plane was delayed getting to Sardinia, and so we waited: but following check-in at Sardinia we were penned into long lines, no seats, extreme heat and no water in the queues. The airport staff in Sardinia appeared to be overwhelmed. Finally got onto the plane and we’re now delayed on the tarmac. We are due to depart more than 3 hours after our scheduled departure time, but so far still stuck on the tarmac with few updates. No water provided. I felt unwell but was told they had no glasses, so nothing to drink. Numerous small children with no hydration and high temperatures. After a second time of asking, I was told I could buy a drink once we took off, but they have no idea when that would be. They need to abandon the flight at this stage before more people become unwell. Cabin crew just standing there, doing nothing but looking perplexed  Barbados to Gatwick. We boarded a half full flight and whilst preparing for take off the video was shown as normal, the crew participation side of it seemed like trouble to the crew. Once inflight the drinks service got under way and service was very quick I had a beer and my partner a soft drink, I was given a room temperature can and no drinking vessel and my partner her soft drink and the standard plastic cup no mention of ice. Within 20 minutes the meal service commenced they got to our seats which were 3 from the back of the aircraft and when we were served two trays appeared and passed to us, I enquired what the meal was and we were both told Pasta it’s all we have left, everyone else had a choice of chicken or pasta, my partner refused her pasta and I proceeded to challenge why on a half filled flight they had run out, no tangible answer came back but was very rudely told she would get chicken from premium economy, I said only one was required as I would eat the pasta, glad I did I think, chicken was placed on my partners tray it was burnt. During this service no further drinks were offered except for water, trays were gathered and that was the last we saw of the crew for 4 hours. They reappeared about 70 minutes before landing served a box containing stale bread with processed cheese and a stale cake, I politely refused the offering and my partner ate the bread, tea and coffee was served.  Our flight out 7 days previously was the exact opposite, pleasant staff, food standard but acceptable. The only other negative was the musical chairs played by fellow passengers, the crew turned a blind eye. The positives the IFE has a wide choice and we got home safely and getting off the aircraft was a pleasure as it was also the coldest flights I have ever been on.  Heathrow to Kalamata. Heathrow T5 to Kalamata, Greece 8th June and return 1 week later. Used Avios points to upgrade to exit row seats for more legroom. Bad news - took off 1 1/2 hours late from Heathrow (delays to previous incoming flight) but made up about 1/2 hour on the journey out. Also left Kalamata about 1/2 hour late on our return but landed virtually on time. Seats much more comfortable with more padding than, for example, Ryanair or Jet2.com so with the extra legroom, the flights were pretty comfortable. Expensive (or course) M&S offerings for food but tasty enough. Pleasant FA\\'s so all in all decent flights. Haven\\'t used BA for short haul for quite a few years but would use again if the price was right. London to Seoul. Nightmare experience with British Airways almost constantly. My Business cabin is downgraded to economy at the last minute with a 12 hours long-hauls flight! Lounge simy sucks, cheap, noisy and croweed. Multiple malfunction items on the aircraft including unfolded table. Given the price it Charge, certainly one of the worst airlines one can possible take. ❎ Newcastle to Delhi via London. At check-in , I was charged for carrying 2.8 kilos extra, which is of no problem. I paid a total of £65 for 2.8 kilos. On my flight from London to Delhi, during boarding I asked for water to which the attendant told she would get but she was busy as customers were boarding the flight. I then  asked for a bottle of water  which she seemed to forget.  2 hours into the  journey, my in-flight entertainment system got stuck on the TV and Radio feature. When the dinner was served, Ithe meal consisted of chicken gravy and mash, along with bread butter and a mousse. Delays caused by British Airways resulted in the flight reaching Delhi late and me missing my connecting flight. But as I landed at Delhi and picked my baggage from the belt, a British Airways staff was ready with another ticket from Delhi to Mumbai without me even asking.   Gatwick to Madrid. When I arrived I waited for one and a half hours for my one suitcase. It didn’t arrive.  I was asked to fill in a ‘lost luggage’ form which I did and given a number to call the next day. The representative said she’d make sure the suitcase was delivered by 5.00 p.m. I was out during the day. When I returned later that evening there was no suitcase. It hadn’t been delivered. The next morning (Sunday) I phoned the number again. The answer message said phone back on Monday. As I was leaving on Sunday night this was pointless. I was leaving Madrid at 8.30 pm. My one suitcase arrived two hours before I left Madrid. So I spent the whole time in Madrid without my medicines, change of clothes, toiletries etc which ended up wasting a lot of my (short, valuable) time buying essentials that I needed whilst there.  My boyfriend and I wanted to return from our trip to London a day early but the BA app and website continued to glitch so I called to ask how much it would be to leave a day earlier. I was told that the penalty fee for changing the flight is $275 each and there’s a $50 fee for them to do it over the phone that’s $600, and the price of a flight by itself. We decided to try our luck again changing it on the app and paid $550 to change our flight to one day earlier to make it back for an event. The flight was delayed and arrived 1hr 55 mins late. We missed our event. The plane was filthy and my tv didn’t work. I asked the flight attendant for something to clean the slimy finger smears off the screen with and she told me it’s normal wear and tear but I could get toilet paper from the bathroom. I called to ask for a refund for the fees since the flight was delayed but they told me they can’t give us a refund because we got on the flight.  London Heathrow to Dubai. Last Sunday we unfortunately missed our BA flight to Dubai due to unforeseen circumstances, so we booked the next available flight for the morning which was with Emirates. Today we arrived at Dubai airport expecting to board the flight home that we had already paid for months in advance. At check in the BA staff told us that our flight had been cancelled as we missed our outgoing flight. We have not received a refund for the seats and they have refused to refund us the tickets we had brought.   Johannesburg to London. I booked a seat without luggage. Firstly one cannot make one booking for two passengers if only one has luggage. This caused an issue when trying to seat together. When the passenger without luggage tried to move seats (normally a free option for standard seats), you get advised that you have to pay. This was not disclosed when the booking was made. It was irritating because one of us was ill.  Inverness to Auckland via Singapore with British Airways. Service was very good but comfort was very bad, for a 14 hour I had no more leg room than I did for an hour flight. I was uncomfortable and as a regular flyer I have used other airlines that provide much more space for long haul flights.  I paid an extra £500 for two Premium economy seats on this long haul flight and was very disappointed. The seat felt small and was shabby, the tv screen was small and very dark. I tried to adjust it but it was still unwatchable. The whole experience was very poor, not Premium in any way. The return flight was a code share with Japan Airines which was Premium, a whole different experience. I would be happy to pay for their Premium seats. I would advise avoid British Airways Premium economy as it is far from Premium. I felt a complete waste of £500.  London to Shanghai. The most disappointing business class I have flown in a long time. The plane was old, worn and dirty (there were crumbs of food on the seat and the floor from a previous flight), It took 2 hours to for drinks service to reach my seat after take off - the food followed shortly, which was over cooked. They seemed to be short on staff. However, what made me really angry was that there were people in the cabin who had had both drinks and food and were having their beds turned down before I’d even been offered a drink. The service was exceptionally poor. I am flying home tomorrow and am not looking forward to the flight. As a Gold card holder, you might have thought BA would check their frequent fliers are being looked after? I’ll return to using other airlines in the one world group for my long haul trips, such as Cathay, JAL or Finnair. The only reason that I’ve given more than one star is that I managed to sleep quite well - the bedding and pillows were good. Ultimately though - sorry BA, not good enough.  London to Doha. Similar to our outbound flight, the seats are comfortable but behind the competition, very small storage area , if you are tall try sleeping sitting up or in the cradle position as the bed is just not long enough. The food portions seems like you are forced to go on a diet, though the taste was ok. The entertainment system had the worst selection of any airline I have flown lately - but their check in baggage policy makes them a very attractive option when you see what their opposition charges for excess luggage.  Larnaca to London. This A320 is totally unsuitable for a flight of this length. The seat pitch and width are the same for economy and club. Having paid €1000 for my flight it\\'s disgraceful on flight where you are sitting for more than 5 hours in an expensive Club Europe seat the personal space is so tight. If the person in front reclined their seat it\\'s a nightmare. The seat in the middle is blocked but getting out if the seats in front are reclined is hazardous.  You pay for a Club ticket for space and comfort and get nothing.   St Lucia to Gatwick on which my wife and I were both involuntarily downgraded from Premium Economy to Economy due overbooking on the flight. It should be noted that at no time was there any announcement for volunteers for downgrading at Vieux Fort Airport. I now know from your cabin crew that it is normal practice for appeals for volunteers to be put over the tannoy system before any enforced downgrades. At the time of going through the baggage hall getting our boarding passes we queried them as none had seat numbers on them to which we were told to just to go through security and our seats would be allocated when we went through the departure gate. Once in the departure lounge all four of us were tannoyed to return to the baggage hall when we were then told that my wife and I were being downgraded to economy. The male telling us this more or less indicated this was the only way we would be getting on the flight giving us £75 per each on a prepayment card as compensation under Article 7.3 of EC 261/2004 stating however that this did not affect our statutory rights. He then told us he would find us in the departure lounge and then all four of us had to go through security once again. The male who we spoke to in the baggage hall did not come and find us, we had to go and find him when he also told me that he had put my wife and I on a row with no other passengers which we assumed, rightly or wrongly, was so we could not tell people sitting beside us about the poor service we had received from BA. However two other passengers did come and sit beside us with the passenger sitting beside my wife telling her this was because the seat they had been allocated was soaking wet and smelt of urine and the cabin crew had asked them to sit on it with a cushion which they had refused and so they were given the seats next to us which was no problem. What further concerned me even more was one of your cabin crew walking past another passenger with their seat in the reclined position on three separate occasions just prior to approaching Gatwick and after the Pilot had requested seat belts on and seats in upright positions, never telling the passenger to raise their seat. BA’s latest advert celebrates 100 years of BA but for me their service is going backwards. The music that accompanies the advert is called ‘Salvation’ and by the end of the flight my wife and I were surely seeking it. Article 10 of EC Regulation 261/2004 is worth reading if this happens to you.  Chicago to London. Cancelled flights just a few hours before I left home, then put me on a different flight which would have made it impossible to make my connecting flight. Was finally put on a different flight. On the way home, because my first flight was through American Airlines, and the second through British Airways (all in the same booking), I was only able to check in and get a seat on the American Airlines flight, as I was redirected every time to their website. Couldn’t check in for the British Airways flight so had to have a middle seat which is very uncomfortable. I always check in 24 hours before to guarantee a seat, but BA wouldn’t allow me to do this.  San Francisco to London. After paying £4000 for flights which I had to cancel, they wouldn\\'t allow any change of dates or change of name, and after all that wouldn\\'t give me the  Avios points because I wont be on the flight.  New York to Venice via London. Staff have been nice when around but aircraft, food, assistance and information all deplorable. Booked Business class. First flight, overnight from JFK to Heathrow - quick, mediocre food service then gone. Chair is set up so I’m staring at a stranger, it’s uncomfortable and difficult to maneuver with no instructions. Didn’t wake me for breakfast, not sure why they had me fill in a form for when I wanted to be woken up. No instructions for the transition between BA flights. Now I’m on the flight from Heathrow to Venice, no offer of coffee, water but worse, business class is just coach class, no extra leg room, just 3 seats with the middle one blocked out. Person in front of me put their seat back and my knees are in my chest. I didn’t pay for international business class to get stuck in uncomfortable seats for 2 long flights. I won’t fly BA again.   Doha to London Heathrow. Flight on time, not completely full, had an aisle seat near back of plane without the entertainment box in the way. Some reviews say that the last few windows are blanked off at rear of the aircraft but not so on this plane. Breakfast was served which was OK. Cabin crew mixed, mostly young and worked quickly. Crew uniform still looks a bit tatty compared with rivals in this part of the world. There is good and bad still with BA - bad was the so called chicken wrap served just before arrival - leathery and inedible - why do they let themselves down with such a poor offering - hardly any passengers near me could eat it. Bad was that there was an old tissue and food wrapper in my seat pocket. Good was the newer aircraft and the breakfast has improved. Arrived on time at Heathrow but to a remote stand. San Diego to London. From the moment that I boarded this flight (due to take off at 19.25), the crew had one interest and one only - to get the cabin lights off, which they duly achieved two hours later. As a consequence, the service was negligent in the extreme. This was a Club World ticket - so expensive and I looked forward to a decent level of service. However, I wasn\\'t offered champagne on boarding, wine with my meal or coffee and port after my meal. I complained to BA when I got home but they weren\\'t interested and I was met with a barrage of corporate platitudes. This flight was a disappointing end to what had been a great trip to the US & Mexico and has left me with a very poor view of the airline. Flown with British Airways on numerous occasions with no issues. However on this occasion my baggage was lost on arrival at Gatwick. There was no British airways representative at the baggage claim however there was a phone that allowed me to call the baggage department. Reclaiming lost baggage was simple and my bag was put on the next flight to Singapore which I received the following day. Edinburgh to Bangalore via Heathrow. Rude staff, poor service, missing baggage, poor entertainment system. I spilled my drink and the attitude of the staff was brutal. I apologised for my clumsiness, but I was made to feel like I had deliberately done some shameful act in public and staff would not want to have anything to do with me. I asked for tissues and the answer was, get it from the toilet. The staff did not even have the courtesy to ask me if I needed another drink once I cleaned myself up. The crew were also extremely noisy. Chatting and laughing loudly at the pantry place for the entire duration. And then - while boarding at Edinburgh, they offered to check in my second bag for free because cabin was full. The staff wrote Bangalore via Heathrow, but my bag was not loaded to connecting flight. 4 hours gap mind you.   Whatever happened to the World\\'s Favourite Airline? Returning from Bermuda to Gatwick we were presented with a worn-out Boeing 777. My seat table was broken with bits of seat plastic hanging off. I had to try and balance the seat tray on my knees so that the dinner tray could be kept flat, it didn\\'t work, tray ended up on the floor with drinks and food. Reported this to steward who was clearly upset with my complaint and told me \\'I\\'ll put it in the book\\'. No apology, no attempt to explain, just irritation from him. The food was awful, neither my wife or I could finish it. It also seemed incomplete with no cheese and biscuits, and nothing to go on the salad. My wife\\'s entertainment screen, didn\\'t work, the passenger next to me screen didn\\'t work and mine only worked intermittently. It look liked something from the Arc with the grid allowing the touch sensitivity clearly visible. I believe the 777s out of Gatwick are being updated, can\\'t come a moment too soon. We purchased Premium Economy tickets for the this flight, we didn\\'t get a premium service. Initially I was going to buy business tickets but the price was ridiculous so I\\'m glad I didn\\'t. My frustration with BA grows every year, we only fly with them now when we have too. London to Miami. Worst long haul business class. That annoying divider, the ridiculous fold down footstool and the worn out seats! The service is non-existent, unless they are serving you the meal. If you want a snack or drink get out your seat and hunt down a cabin member, they don’t ask you if you need anything between meals. The toilets are dirty and basic. I’m a Gold Member but giving it up to fly other more updated airlines. They’ve crammed as many business class seats as possible at the expense of comfort and it’s not like they’re cheap.  Barcelona to New York via London. I was in Barcelona for just four days so had one small bag which they asked me to check. My flight from Barcelona to London was delayed causing  passengers to miss their connections. When I finally got a flight, we taxied for an hour and then were told we needed to return to the gate as the luggage was loaded incorrectly. It took me nearly 24 hours to travel from Barcelona to JFK.  When I arrived, my luggage wasn\\'t there so I filed a claim. I called and emailed every day and they couldn\\'t find it even though I had a tag number and and documentation. Eight days later, they finally contacted me and gave me a six hour window for bag delivery. The final insult is that I was expected to file a claim for my missing personal property within seven days. As a result, they have offered me no compensation for damages.   I forgot I had purchased a hand baggage only fare. At the airport I was charged more than 60 euros for my bag which came out as almost as much as the fare itself cost. The staff at check-in could not have been less helpful. The whole experience was of a bad low-cost airline. Boarding process saw me in Category 5 having to board last, not so much as a glass of water is offered. The seats have very little legroom and just one toilet for the A319 economy cabin.   London to Berlin scheduled for 21st December. On approach to the airport, I got a message saying that my flight was canceled. No explanation was given. As I arrived at the airport, staff acted very confused and said their rerouting center is closed for the evening due to issues, and if I wanted to travel in the next days ahead of Christmas I should book my own travel with another airline or train company (e.g. Eurostar). My costs would  be reimbursed. The airport staff also said no further help from British Airways is available on the day to due airport issues. I felt the only way out was to rebook myself with a different airline for a hefty +300 GBP fare for a short haul flight for the next day. As it was Christmas, prices were very high. After I arrived at my destination, a lengthy exchange of messages with British Airways started, and British Airways said in the end they do not compensate costs for rerouting with a different airline (opposite to what their airport staff said on the day of cancellation).   Our return journey from Sydney to London, which was approximately 22 hours in duration with a stop at Singapore airport, was faced with one major issue. We flew economy class with a two year old, whose inflight entertainment headphone socket wasn’t working. Having paid £723 for our two year olds ticket, you would except the inflight entertainment to be working on such a long flight. Having complained to the cabin crew they did their best but unfortunately the socket could not be fixed. We were offered to move seats to the only 2 seats available however there were three of us so this was not practical. The cabin crew gave us some First Class goodies including a bottle of champagne for the inconvenience caused and they also said that all they could offer us in monitory terms was £25. They said they would contact BA customer services on our behalf to complain and to expect more compensation than what the crew could offer us. By the time we had got off the plane and were in baggage claim, I had already received an email from BA C/S and that they would respond within 48 hours, which they did. However, all the could offered was a £20 voucher to use on another BA flight. I replied declining this and said this was as insult to what we had originally paid for the flight and explained what the cabin crew had said. I also said I had no intention of booking any foreseeable flights with any airline therefore an eVoucher is worthless to me. There was no other alternative or any means of reasoning. The flight was basic and the seats were uncomfortable. BA also offer WiFi on the plane but when you try to use it, they charge £4.99 per hour in economy class.  Gatwick to Tenerife. This aircraft either needs a refit or needs retiring! G-MEDK is by far the most uncomfortable plane I have ever been on. I paid extra for an extra leg room seat - 12A because I always feel happier without my knees under my chin for a four hour flight. I reckon it was no more than half an hour into my flight that the total lack of padding on the seat turned this flight into an ordeal. It was like sitting on concrete! I would imagine that when this aircraft was new (2005 I believe) the leather seating was quite yielding and comfortable but now with thirteen years of backsides compressing the padding, it was dreadful. I took the precaution of changing my seat for the return and sneaking on a seat pad purchased in Lanzarote which, coupled with there being no passengers next to me, made the flight in 11F a little more bearable. Staff were fine on the outward leg but a little tired by the time I returned at night ten days later. I normally travel Easyjet on this route but on this occasion, I used some Avios to make the flight less expensive. Easyjet offer two trolley runs but only 1 on these BA flights. With their diminishing attitude to customer welfare, I will not use BA on any lengthy flights as the service and comfort offered by Easyjet is, in my experience, far superior.\\r\\n  Booked a flight through Expedia for June 21019 from Denver to Paris via London on the promise that I could upgrade using Avios. After booking the flight and trying to upgrade, was notified that I could not upgrade the flight due to how I purchased the ticket, paid about $250 for early seat selection on both flights, after buy up to the front of the plane, was notified that my seats were changed to the back of the plane with no explanation, - but found out they gave the seats, that I paid extra for, to another party. Could request a refund, but wouldn\\'t honor what they had sold me in the first place. They would not honor a refund either. Then I became ill and they chose not to refund my fare of $3380 plus paid for upgrades.   Johannesburg to London. I had a bulkhead seat on the upper deck. The only advantage is that nobody will step over you during the night. BA has been using the same configuration of seats in business for the last 20 years, and it is time for them to step up their game if they want to keep people flying with them. The business class seat is not wider than the premium economy seat, the difference is that it goes to a full bed. There is no room or to put down a glass other then taking out the table. As it was a late flight (10pm), the crew decided not to offer pre-dinner drinks. I ordered the quick meal option in order to get more sleep. Big mistake: you only get the appetiser (tiny) and the desert (even smaller). I was still hungry and they refused to serve me my main dish as they reserved it for the crew. The trays are removed when everyone else finishes, so much for getting more sleep. The crew never came back until breakfast. That flight was a total disappointment.  Cape Town to London. Very unimpressive amenities and service. Unless you have a bulkhead seat, there is no way to leave the seat without either stepping over someone or having them step over you. There is a small storage drawer but nowhere to stow even small carry-on baggage except in the bin above. The food was at best pedestrian and no wine was served with dinner except by request and then it took ages to get. My husband got no cutlery on his tray and couldn\\'t get the attention of steward to rectify (I gave him one of the two sets on mine). I, on the other hand never got the main course. I finally went and asked and it was delivered cold and over-cooked.  We have been loyal customers with British Airways since I was a little girl. Every summer we booked airline tickets with this company to visit my grandparents in Italy. On October 17th I booked 3 airline tickets to visit my grandparents leaving October 31st coming back November 12th as my grandfather was very sick and didn’t have much longer to live. On October 19th my grandfather passed away. We put in a cancellation/refund request because the sole purpose was to see him one last time. As British Airways did refund us for our tickets but refused to refund us $150 of our seats even though we never used their services. This has been frustrating to deal with on top of the loss of my grandfather. In addition, every employee we have spoken to on the phone had probably the worse customer service experience I’ve ever encountered.  I am beyond disappointed with this company and neither my family nor I will fly with them in the future.   Nassau to London. Premium Economy on BA is a joke. Highlighted by my Friday morning 7am breakfast. A glass of water and a breakfast box containing a cold, sealed in plastic, Croissant and an equally sealed Banana Bread/Cake. No hot food/drink; awful. That after a night battling with intermittent service on the seat back screen,  a screen no larger than in Economy. The only benefit for the money was early off the plane with luggage prioritised to the collection area. The extra leg room was about OK but the seat was simply uncomfortable for a 6/2 225lb male - yes large but not obese. BA Premium Economy - forget it. Other airlines do this better.  San Diego to Hannover via London. I booked on ba.com, the longer flights both ways in premium economy.  On the return I was informed at San Diego that the American Airlines flight into DFW was severely delayed and I would miss my flight into London. American Airlines could book me on a later flight the same day, but had only  coach available. If I insisted on premier economy I could fly in 3 days. I took the coach and American assured my that BA would refund the fare difference for this downgrade. After arrival at home I contacted BA on their website to refund the fare difference. A bizarre exchange followed. First they said you did not buy any upgraded seat. I told them to look at the ticket. You can\\'t get a refund because the economy class seat was much more expensive that the booked premium economy seat. I contacted BA Germany who said you get a refund, but you booked this with a travel agent, so we are not in charge.  I booked with BA on their website. They saidthey would send this to London so they can compute the refund, but then you can\\'t get a refund because your seat was much more expensive than the premium seat you booked months in advance. The change in booking was the sole fault of the delayed American Airlines flight. This is miserable customer service.  London Heathrow to Stuttgart. Absolutely disgusted with BA. my husband was asked to put his one piece of hand luggage in the hold due to the flight being busy and he agreed. BA had one job to do - put it in the hold and make sure it arrives in Stuttgart. This has proven too difficult. The bag is lost and they have not offered any assistance or support.  Basel to San Fransisco via Heathrow. I\\'m convinced the quality has dropped considerably in the past several years. I booked World Traveller Plus or Premium Economy which costs appr. twice as much as economy. The flight to SFO was ok seat wise as the plane was an A380 and I has reserved an aisle seat. The food was disgusting for me, during the flight we were given a box with several pieces of junk food and shortly before landing given a piece of pizza. The choice of food leaves a lot to be desired. There were cold drinks offered regularly and you can go to the bulkhead to get extra if needed. We were offered maybe two hot drinks during the 12 hours on the plane (longer due to a delay leaving the UK). The flight back to the UK was worse since it was a Boeing 747 with the older bulkier seats. You couldn\\'t even get to the remote control hidden in the inside of the seat and I\\'m not big. The recliner didn\\'t work properly and the general space around the seat is cramped as the person next to me spilled over to my seat. I feel sorry for larger people. The food was just as bland and poor and barely any warm drinks. The staff seem challenged with certain situations. Next time I\\'m off to the US I will look for an alternative airline. London to Bangkok. I am not a fan if the BA configuration in Business. However I did have seat 2J so it was right up front. I am not sure where to begin. Food awful, I ordered beef (a showcase of British beef the notes said) that was inedible I left most of it. Instead of asking was something wrong or would I like another meal option, the FA took the tray away and asked if I wanted dessert. Wine 2 reds 2 whites and 2 champagnes - hardly a stellar wine list. Entertainment small screen with dreadful resolution and a very limited ordinary range of options. Staff challenged at best, clearly some had not been in business before. Disengaged and disinterested. The cabin was over hill for me. The toilet was not checked very often, a sweet wrapper remained on the toilet floor the entire trip as did an overflowing rubbish bin. I would expect much better up the front of the plane we pay a premium to be there and the service and overall product do not match expectations.   Abu Dhabi to London. Although a BA flight, this sector was operated by Air Belgium and offered a really poor experience. Aircraft felt old and tired, cabin crew were totally indifferent, cabin temperature was too hot and stuffy and food totally inedible. A really awful flight and worth looking at alternatives if you need to fly this route in the near future.  London to Los Angeles. Booked this trip eight months previously and as I lost my status on BA a few years ago were forced to pay an additional £180 for our two seats. The flight I chose was a Boeing 787 and was prepared to part with the extra cash so we could be in the small front cabin. Never expecting anything to go according to plan with BA and our flight was cancelled a few days before. We were rebooked onto a later flight which they changed from an A380 to a twenty one year old Jumbo. We were then seated right at the back of Club World to benefit from a screaming child sat in the front row of premium. We were greeted by a rather pleasant steward who told us he would be looking after us for the trip, he then disappeared never to be seen again. Food was served within an hour of take off for an eleven hour flight. The steak so tough was it impossible to cut and could only be eaten by picking up and biting pieces off. After a few hours I went  to the galley to seek out a drink as the crew had disappeared, stood there being completely ignored by three stewardesses. Reluctantly one stopped chattering and managed to get me a drink. The second meal was served about seven hours after lunch, steak sandwich, at least that one was edible. The seat was as you would expect on such an old plane totally knackered, getting out was a task in itself. I bought WiFi for the whole trip, it ran for about 50% of the flight, yet their customer (non existent) services refuse to refund the payment even though I sent them a whole host of screenshots showing at various times there was no wifi service, but they are happy to note the problems. We have avoided BA now for some time, except where there is no other option as on Club Europe. But with transatlantic they are probably the bottom of the pile. We only took this trip to use up some Avios, they have all been used now and we could come back from LAX on Virgin Atlantic. Never again, BA club world offered is a farce in today\\'s business market.  I was in Prague flying British Airways back to Heathrow. Apparently there were thunderstorms in London so the flights were being delayed. My 17:15 flight was delayed until 8 am the next morning. There was no British Airways person at the Prague airport to relay this message: some consolidator passed out sheets of paper advising people of the remuneration available to them should they spend the night and wait for the 8 am flight. The sheet of information didn\\'t offer any hotel suggestions or ideas of how to get back into Prague. This consolidator also mentioned that there was a 20:00 flight and there was room for thirty people on this flight. So after calling British Airways and finding  their offices were  closed for the evening, I went  online and booked the flight. Because of the late timing, I was charged $356USD. Then after countless emails and hours spent trying to get through on the phone, I finally learned that BA would only reimburse me the non-used flight that I had booked 3 months earlier- at a cost of $96 USD. They also said they would send me a $50 flight voucher: not sure how many months it will take until I receive it. Is there any other airline that doesn\\'t simply rebook a significantly delayed passenger on the next flight and not try to extract outrageous sums from them? I will never fly British Airways again.  London Heathrow to New York JFK. The First Wing at Terminal 5 was rubbish tonight, 20 or so deep and it’s really the only decent part of BA’s ground operation. Flight left late due to repairs then the usual wait for a tow in at Kennedy made us overall late. Staff very cheerful. This route gets decent catering normally but only 3 main options and the Indian chicken was very bland.  London Heathrow to Brindisi. We weren’t expecting the long queue for Club Europe check-in, but mid-afternoon is apparently particularly busy in T5. Galleries South lounge was also teeming, but at least the filthy chairs had been replaced and there was a reasonable selection of hot and cold food. Group boarding was handled efficiently. The A321 was relatively new and clean, no pre-take-off drinks were offered. Departure was delayed by about 30 minutes but arrival was on time. The Club Europe section was unusually busy, with at least ten, fully occupied rows, including families with pre-school children. Despite the congestion and chaos, the food and drink service was handled efficiently, although the food was no better than the old World Traveller offering. It’s hard to see the point of BA’s short haul business class product when the experience is second rate. I have BA silver membership. This promises fast track, choice of seats at booking, priority boarding and lounge access. I would advise all travellers that in reality these benefits are intermittent at best and unavailable at worst. The majority of the time my seat choice is changed, fast track at Heathrow is slower than the normal queue, and the lounges so overcrowded that it\\'s sometimes hard to find a seat. The Iberia lounge at Madrid is equality poor, with stale tortilla the only offering at breakfast. British Airways is a rip off. I have uploaded by way of example a seat map of their A321 and seat 22c. This seat is not extra legroom and is cramped like the others. Yet on BA.com they will try to sell it as an exit seat as if it has extra legroom. I recently travelled on Virgin Atlantic and Cathay Pacific in business and economy and it really struck me just how abysmal BA/Iberia are by comparison.  Hamburg to London. Initial flight from London cancelled from under us 3 days from departure and we had a firm booking to collect a motorhome upon arrival. Total chaos. Ground service appalling and no free service on board. Checkin from Hamburg appallingly slow, and didn\\'t open until 2 hrs from departure. Check in demanded that cabin baggage be checked in while we demanded we keep it. All in all an unsatisfactory airline.  Budapest to London Heathrow. The flight departed in time and would have arrived ahead of schedule if the gate had not been occupied by the previous aircraft. The ride was a bit bumpy, but was not too serious. The flight was full (with kids) and the crew did everything to make the journey smooth. I did not purchase any food, but I saw they ran out of a lot of options due to the unexpected number of on-board purchases. Singapore to London. They wanted to charge me an extra GBP65 for being over the 23kg limit. The legroom seemed very small to me, the flight was super full and I was sitting next to a big woman who spilled over her side of the seat. I was asked if I would like tea or coffee with my breakfast and the steward said he will come back with the tea. After a long time I managed to catch the same guy walking by and asked him for my tea and he just said that there was no tea.   Rome to London. Our flight was delayed from Rome by an hour and we could not connect to the next flight to Los Angeles as we landed in Heathrow 20 minutes before the departure. There were no staff members who helped us and they have conveniently put us on the next flight tomorrow. They put us on a hotel next to airport and provided dinner but did not provide additional vouchers for snacks and other stuff.  London to Athens. Since I started using BA in 2011, I can only say that the quality becomes worse. The leg room in Business Class in A320 is the same like in economy. The only thing that you get is an empty middle seat. The meal choices are poor: I had to choose between curry and fish pie. Also, they first brought us the starter and the dessert and after 5-10 mins (once we ate the starter), they took the starter plate and they gave us the main. The on board service, is less \\'attentive\\' than some years ago (probably cabin crew are over-utilised and want to get some rest which is understandable). Also, due to the plane being late, the cabin was not cleaned properly. At some point we need to think why would someone choose BA over low cost airlines. Tickets are priced in a similar way, there is no food on board for the economy (while for business the portion and variety are a joke), leg space is small, there are always delays to depart from Heathrow (not BAs fault, but at the end of the day I experience delays). What is that makes BA in European flights distinct? Probably nothing.  London to Paris. I wish that they would update their aircraft or perhaps even do a little refurbishing. Especially when the seats feel worn out and the quality for what you are paying for does not feel worth it. That being said, this is better than any low-cost carrier.  Aberdeen to Boston via London Heathrow. I found the seats weren\\'t wide enough and leg room was restricted. On the way back to London the person in front of me put the seat back as well and this severely decreased and room I had to move. Also the narrower seats meant that I really had to avoid taking up both arm rests. Otherwise they were good flights with, slightly odd choices, but decent food. Extensive entertainment options/variety as well.  Flew to Istanbul with British Airways on 5th June. At the passport/visa check desk, presented printed boarding pass to the BA lady - my wife was holding the passports. The lady looked at the boarding passes and barked \\'Passports\\' as if she did not see my wife holding them. Second bark: \\'Do you have a visa?\\'. Third bark: \\'Show me\\'. Fourth bark: \\'Next\\'. No smile, no \\'Hello\\' or \\'Good morning\\'. Hardly any eye contact either. If anything, the situation was worse at boarding. BA recently introduced a boarding-by-group-number system. All such systems need to be policed, but there are ways of policing the arrangements. Some passengers attempted to board before their group number was call. When caught by the gate keeper, they were told, \\'Not Yet\\'. Some attempted to board prematurely more than once. On the second attempt, the staff told them to wait. Accepting that the system must be monitored, BA gate staff should be better trained how to deal with (potentially) anxious passengers and reminded that not everyone speaks or understands English.  London to Madrid. Lazy seat allocation has led to my husband and I not sitting together.  I understand I can pay to get a seat I want but other than having a seat next to my husband I don’t want any particular seat. We are travelling as a pair. There are three seats each side of the aisle. There will likely be single passengers travelling who have chosen a seat preventing us from sitting together as they don’t know what groups are travelling and do t care where they sit. BA bothering to do the seat allocations for all the passengers you don’t wish to pay for specific seats would avoid this.   Had four flights in total with this airline, first flight from Dublin to London on 29th June 2018 was delayed by 2 hours. This delay would have meant we missed our connection in Heathrow to Miami except that plane was also delayed by 2 hrs (no reason or apologies). We arrived in Miami hours behind schedule which took away our only evening there as we were getting a cruise the following morning. By the time we arrived we had missed our hotel transfer causing further expense as we had to hail a cab. Our flights home to Dublin via Heathrow were fine until we reached Dublin and realised they had lost our bag. Despite assurances it would be delivered to our house later that day (it was put on the wrong plane - again no apologies given for this inconvenience). We are still awaiting the bags arrival and the phone numbers we were given keep ringing out. Seems like no one cares. This was our first and last experience of using BA.  Johannesburg to Heathrow. British Airways are not doing us proud. I recently flew back from South Africa with some sports equipment. Their web site states that you can take sports equipment as part of your luggage allowance, but I was charged £65 to bring my bike back. The check in staff were very forceful and abrupt. As I had to bring the bike back, I had no choice but to pay. When I got back I contacted their customer service, they are not willing to help.  Also, the seats are getting really uncomfortable. The food is terrible.  I have flown British Airways numerous times over many years. Sadly the experience has deteriorated significantly recently and this flight was particularly poor. The staff were offhand and one seemed particularly unhappy to be there. The person next to me and I asked for the beef choice but were told that there was none left - too little had apparently been loaded. There was no apology and we were simply told we needed to make another choice. We asked for the fish. After some delay we were given our meals but found we had both been given a vegetarian meal. I had to walk down to the galley to let them know and was told in a very offhand manner that they must have recorded the wrong choice - no apology. Eventually we received the fish which by then was dry and not enjoyable. We were asked for breakfast choices and gave in cards which stated we wanted a light choice 40 minutes before landing. We were not given anything. The service was really poor - and as usual the business seats were falling behind the quality and comfort found in other airlines. BA will really have to improve their product to continue to attract premium passengers.'"

       "' i wouldnt recommend british airways at all i tried to call to customer service for  times in different days and time and i waited for more than  minutes on the phone i ended hanging up they are excusing themselves in the high volume of calls i write an email an i am still waiting for  weeks  website is difficult to navigate it is not easy really to have an invoice of proof of receipt or look for another service they sent you online but you dont receive a pdf file so if you need a proof of flight you need to do screenshots and once the flight is flown you have no access to that booking again to reprint any document or try to create a pdf you need to contact with a customer service which i did it online long waiting time and had to wait more than a week to receive it expensive and poor almost inexistent customer service and difficult to use their website an airline that definitely wouldnt recommend it is such a shame that in  they are still in this position and sleeping when they have competitors around  literally the worst flight of my life after booking tickets together with my partner we were then separated ‘sorry the flight is full’ the flight then took off  minutes late  no apology the trolley service took over two hours and they periodically skipped rows and the response was flippant and rude ‘whoops not sure how that happened what do you want’ genuinely appalling from beginning to end might as well fly easy jet  at least they charge a price commensurate with the poor quality of service not like ba  obviously many airlines have gone downhill in recent years prices have increased and services have gone down the most disappointing thing about ba is that aspects that really don’t need to get worse have the check in staff at heathrow are downright rude and abusive shouting at passengers to line here and there and rolling their eyes if passengers get confused with the constant shouting and bullying airlines are now competing globally more and more and this behaviour is particularly noticeable in asia where the service industry is next level i wouldn’t want to suggest that all the staff are like this and many younger employees are polite and helpful however there were a couple of older staff that were downright rude and obnoxious   generally poor sent to gate on time sat maybe  minutes was then announced as crew were not familiar with the a there would be a delay clearly nonsense and there was a retraction on board of this statement watched the crew walk through to the gate my impression was they did not want to be there was given a miniscule amount of water small bag of pretzels and then it was announced there would be a wait for any further cabin service as card processing machines were us no further updates or sight of crew for next two hours then attempted to charge us for even a glass of water when i said this should be complimentary girl said it was not her problem and walked away  i was horrified by the extremely small seats and the poor training that the crew clearly receives not one of them exuded any kind of warmth or expressed any desire to make our journey pleasant the seats were so narrow that regardless of the size of your neighbors you are forced to touch each other constantly if the seat in front of you is reclined you have no choice but to recline your own or else you are breathing in the head scalp of the person in front of you food was revolting they dont even provide napkins unless you ask with the premeal drinks and the secondary meal the last time i flew ba it was a completely other experience and i was so sorry to see how far the quality level has slid it was really majorly disappointing and i regret that i have already purchased  other intercontinental trips with the company i will now have to see if i can change them the pathetic  ml bottle of water its just a sip on the shorter flights the seats couldnt even be reclined which was a great pity since the flight was delayed by almost  hours and we had to wait on board  a catalogue of failures we flew from belfast to heathrow a week ago and the flight was delayed by over three and a half hours we missed our onward air canada flight to calgary as a result on arriving in calgary after rerouting via vancouver which added over  hours to our journey we met other passengers who had also missed the same air canada flight as their british airways flight from manchester had also been delayed by several hours we are now on our way home only to find our heathrow to belfast flight which had already been cancelled and put back  hours is now delayed by another  hours avoid british airways like the plague  if i could give a minus rating i would supposed to be lhrams at  on th march get to lhr at  email to say flight cancelled no one able to help at lhr said to use the app only halfway sensible option was from lcyams at  so taxi over there as trains from lhr not working ok not bas fault get to lcy showing as cancelled on screen so check the app and there it is rebook again via the app to the  departure go to desk to drop bag and was told that i was only on standby for the flight with no guarantee of a seat despite the app telling me it was confirmed the  to ams was already overbooked so was moved onto the  flight to rotterdam the  and  were both cancelled anyway as it happened eventually took off and the best thing i can say is that it landed intact return from amslhr similar story arrive at ams screen shows the  is cancelled quickly check app and confirmed it was no emails no texts nothing rebooked via app to the  departure so could have been worse desk agent helpfully printed me a boarding card as the app was unable to issue anything for a rebooked flight overall dreadful they just dont care and hide behind apps and automated call centres avoid unless you have no other option and even then stop and consider if you really need to go  this was literally one of the worst experiences i haven’t been to an airport since it began in orlando flying back the flight plan system went down and we were stuck on the tarmac for  hours poor customer service and just ignored at times then missed my connecting flight and we were told not to leave the baggage area without our bags even though i booked through to dublin another  hours i was told my bags were lost and to continue to the desk to book a flight another hour later i was handed a card with a number and told to ring it i was cut off three times and told i wouldn’t be able to get home that day despite several flights being available just booked my own flight and had lost my suit and presents for christmas and missed an engagement party  at  am on the day of travel whilst driving to london heathrow i received an email advising my flight had been cancelled i was offered an alternative flight with american airlines which i had no alternative but to accept as i must travel today i was flying to la to see a family member who is end of life the american airlines desk downgrade my cabin from premium economy to economy tried  times ba provide telephone number total useless no help given me wrong email address for sending my complains given to me in the email i have been a ba frequent flyer for decades and have been a loyal customer i now find i am travelling  hours in economy without even the possibility of a refund let alone an upgrade this is completely unacceptable what has happened to this company i have had better treatment from ryanair  flew premium only worth the extra money for the bit of extra room penny pinching means there’s no other benefit  one drink service on  hour flight no fizz offered before take off poor food boarding was badly organised food left on tables  min before landing with no tea and coffee offered few small cups of water passed around but nothing “premium” about this new planes have been decorated terribly  feels like you’re in a dentist waiting room devoid of any personality or joy only fly if the only option only fly premium if it’s not too expensive  seriously not worth much more than economy these days especially if you’re in the middle   my review relates to the appalling experiences i had with british airways on th february  i was due to travel to madrid with british airways and before setting off i heard on the radio that there were flight delays i looked at the heathrow airport website and saw that my flight had been cancelled as a result of the information on the website i called british airways and have  minutes on hold i found myself speaking to somebody in a call centre in south africa the person was hard to understand due to a heavy accent and he was incompetent and insisted that the flight was not cancelled i made my way to heathrow and sure enough the flight was indeed cancelled the woman in question had the audacity to declare that the flight was cancelled and that “there are no facilities here at the airport to rebook you” she refused to let me and about  other people join the queue for the clearly marked assistance desk the same woman and one of her colleagues gave out a card with a telephone number and told one rather elderly gentleman to “go online to rebook your seat” i am visually impaired and found the attitude of the ba employee to be appalling i called the number on the card the employee gave me and was again in a long queue to a call centre the person who picked up the phone kept me waiting  minutes and declared that the flight was not cancelled and that the airport “must be wrong” he then in a flippant tone said he was just informed that the flight was indeed cancelled and that i would have to go and speak to iberia customer services in heathrow to rebook i took the elderly gentleman with me to iberia where the counter staff member rolled her eyes in disgust and said that it was nothing to do with iberia i returned to ba and this time i joined the checkin line and told a checkin agent what had happened the man in question booked me onto the next available flight within a matter of a few minutes he gave me a £ voucher as a form of compensation but said he could not add my frequent flyer number with a partner airline the voucher proved useless i am afraid as various shops in the predepature area refused to accept it and although i was told i could use it after clearing security none of the shops would accept it once aboard my new flight the service was minimal other than a tiny bottle of water and a packet of pretzels nothing else was available this was a full flight as so many people had been transferred from the cancelled flight ba cabin crew announced that any additional items other than the small bottle of water and pretzels had to be ordered via their skyshop  outward journey ba london to buenos aires club world  january  our experience was poor from beginning to end although we had reserved seats f and j another passenger was occupying f and crew made no attempt to address the problem eventually i persuaded the passenger to move and occupy her designated seat d we boarded punctually but were not offered drinks when i asked for a drink the crew member said it was too late and blamed the seating problem the same crew member then began taking orders for dinner but did not write them all down and gave up after a few minutes for the safety briefing she asked us to repeat our orders later the hot flannels smelled musty and felt old and ragged  one of the crew wondered aloud whether my companion and i were related  my soup was cold i was told it was served from flasks was that an explanation or an excuse my coffee was weak and tasted like instant granules my companion was initially served no bread roll with dinner the breakfast menu stated a selection of rollspastries but there was no choice and my companion was given a dried fruit pastry where he would have chosen a bread roll  although we had not previously asked for or been offered any other than those supplied at the seat small bottles of water ran out return journey ba buenos aires to london heathrow world traveller plus  january  was a huge contrast from the warm welcome on boarding to crew’s professionalism throughout it’s a poor reflection on club world service that our experience in world traveller plus was so much better and kinder weighed against the advantages of a flat bed the considerable price difference was not worth paying for the catalogue of errors and inconveniences outlined above check in agent at lhr was very helpful and friendly as were the in flight crew seat was comfortable with good leg room however the food was poor  barely better than economy class with a poor quality and limited selection of wine in flight entertainment selections we’re very limited far inferior to what ba used to offer overall this premium economy product was disappointing and very poor value for money definitely not recommended especially for business class the seats are ridiculous and small the food is mediocre if that and good luck with the internet even if you pay for full internet for the entire flight the service however has been great my attendant saved me from crying i don’t know who designed this aircraft but in this expensive business class in order to move out of you middle seat to go to the bathroom you must rudely climb over the person’s legs sitting in the aisle seat your seat is like an enclosed tiny cubicle with no storage space i’ve unfortunately traveled british airways business class at least  times within the last  months never again unless there is no other choice by the way the business class lounge south at heathrow is a cattle pen  absolutely terrible experience with british airways after a short flight from london heathrow to frankfurt they couldnt get my suitcase to me in time for my next flight on cathay pacific to melbourne despite a  hour gap between the two flights told me they would arrange for the suitcase to be transferred directly to melbourne  instead it got to hong kong and left there when they finally tracked it down they sent it back to london all happened over christmas so very stressful yet minimal communication from their team while the plane crew may be lovely the service outside of this has been nothing short of dreadful and if given the option i will avoid flying with them in future turned up  hours in advance terminal  at london heathrow was already carnage s of people trying to check in only  desks manned long queues at security due to only  lines open people stressed pushing shouting and flight delayed by  hours according to pilot delay due to suitcases all needing to be loaded missed connecting flight in doha  hours wait til next one received a voucher approx £ for the whole day arrived  day later my suitcase didn’t arrive with me filed a claim at the desk for  days no update no information no offer of compensation and no solution offer i now have a spoilt holiday many personal belongings are gone xmas gifts missing extensive expenses i don’t know if i will be reimbursed beware with ba expect low level or zero customer service old planes and zero help if anything goes wrong or missing i will personally avoid ba in future at all costs  stupidly tried ba again after a five year gap and paid over £ for my wife and i to go to barbados because i thought the new business class layout might rival virgin atlantic on the route about six months ago ba announced they were switching planes to the old antique pushmepullyou layout but it was too late to reorganise our holiday logistics sure enough we suffered the most appallingly uncomfortable flights with no room eight seats across worn out fittings inedible food and surly fas extremely subpar service highlights no online meal selection staff pretty much dropped off whatever meal they had and were very rude if a passenger wanted it changed last meal was delayed to the last  minutes of flight plates were literally grabbed away i had to hand over my unfinished plate that the staff again dropped on me no apology no offer of a napkin i had to scrounge for a piece of paper to clean my jacket none of the passengers were told to straighten up their seats before meal because the seat before me was so tilted i could barely keep the plate on the tray without things slipping off staff walked down with some water and biscuits this got exhausted just before she got to me she just looked at me and walked away nothing further was offered  flying lhr t to cpt november   ba app and website not working properly  would not load my ticket lhr t smooth and calm checking process quick  but boarding card would not scan at security they gave me one for someone else to a different destination  ran back to checkin to get correct one bags also tagged incorrectly and had disappeared  someone ran off to find my bags in the depths of t and retag them amazingly they did show up in cape town  told only main lounge was open not b and c pier lounges turns out this was false information  b pier lounge was open but i was in main lounge which was overcrowded and worn out arrived late to the gate train not working there was a biz class lane quick but then a giant queue to get on the plane as they only had one airbridge not two seat comfy and cabin clean but the sinks were taped up as the waste was not working i was offered hand sanitiser instead but this is disgusting imagine going to the bathroom and not being able to wash your hands as there is no sink unbelievable that ba dispatches planes in this condition food average wine served way too late choice of wine with cold food or eat food first and matching wines come a quarter of an hour later overall experience  flew air france fortalaza to cdg to lhr two weeks earlier which was way better how embarrassing for ba  check in was a shambles at bwi just  counters open for a very full flight the bag drop queue was even longer than the regular checkin queue boarding was done by zones so that was carried out reasonably well once on board the fas were fine not as engaging on my outbound flight to iad the aircraft was cramped and the seats in economy were horrible i was seated in an aisle seat row f where there is an entertainment box taking up a third of your legroom overall very cramped seat poor legroom and awful ife screens the meal was mediocre and there was no bar service before the meal this time on lading we were served a hot sandwich which had oozing cheese all over the wrapper so it was not pleasant to handle but tasted very good the plane landed at a remote stand which meant that we had to be bussed to t and since it was raining it was not a nice experience overall i rate this just as a mediocre journey  i booked the flight on oct  but have to cancel the flight on the same day after learning that i cant get my entry visa in time for the flight and i did receive a confirmation email says my flight was canceled but in the cancellation email the booking reference number is a different one so i requested cancellation but ba canceled another persons flight and sent the confirmation to my email i assumed that my flight was canceled but after more than  weeks i still have not received any refund so i reached out and it turned out my flight is still on and it is getting even more ridiculous when you try to reach out to ba i tried multiple different ways phone calls and emails but none was able to investigate what actually happened nor has the authority help cancel my flight without paying penalty based on my experience no ones reads your email carefully no matter how much context you put in given all i have experienced i have zero faith in british airways  we boarded our flight at edinburgh to london for our connecting flight to san francisco on th october there were a lot of americas heading back to america from scotland because of the open golf at st andrews the woman at the counter was rude i was actually embarrassed to be british at the time shouting snapping at people and just had a real horrible way about her on the flight from london to san francisco prior to the  hour check in i spent £ to reserve two seats for our once in a life time holiday to america once we boarded it was evident that the seat i was sitting in was broken the recliner button was not working and had been pushed into the frame of the arm rest i asked the flight attendant at the time of there was anything that could be done but not only was she also rude but seemed uninterested in that fact that i was going to have to sit for  hours on a flight with a seat that wouldnt recline i eventually got the flight to state that she would report the fault only to find out that multiple other seats on the economy seating area were also broken attitude with british airways staff has been absolutely horrendous so after getting off the flight i decided to make a complaint to british airways bearing in mind that i had paid £ for the privilege of picking a seat i asked for a refund for the cost of the booking of the seat prior to the  hour check in only to be told no they dont do refunds i paid for a product that was broken met with nothing but rude staff and they are telling me they cant refund the cost of booking the seat  emails to the customer team and they are still refusing they are also refusing to tell me whether or not that the fault was reported prior to me sitting in that seat all they have now offered me is a £ ba voucher which i declined on the basis that if they picked my seats for example i hadnt payed for the seats prior to the  hour check in then a £ voucher would be ok but not when i have spent my own money to select a seat that was broken after all my experiences with ba i will not be using them again very rude and unhelpful staff and i will chose another carrier in the future im actually ashamed that ba treats people the way they do when they are a national airline for great britain  while entering the aircraft it was very rushed no smooth boarding people were struggling with cabin luggage and finding their seats and heating was high that i was suffocating i got faint due to that heat but the cabin crew were very helping so all the thanks to those who helped me at that time other then that when i called cabin crew to ask for some water they took half an hour to response  london to cairo first on this  hour mid morning flight the only complimentary food and drink were a tiny bag of pretzels and a small bottle of water even southwest is more generous when unable to connect my phone to order food i hit the fa call button with no response for more than an hour when the fa came to collect garbage i had to show him the call light and he gruffly asked me what was the matter he used his phone to place the order  this review is for ba booking system not a flight  today i clicked wrong date on line my mistake and expect to pay a fee i then go to “cancel booking” and click on the option to not receive a voucher immediately i received a response saying my voucher is on its way i call them and speak to a gentleman who continuously spoke over me and would not listen to my concerns and eventually i give up and want to book a new flight obviously at a much higher price but using the voucher i didn’t want however to my surprise i am unable to use this voucher because they can’t tell me what it is until i receive it at a point in the future that they can’t say when so they now have my money and i have to rebook at full cost in the end in order to get me off the phone they hung up  our flight in march  from san francisco to london on th march was cancelled with  hours’ notice we found out on the shuttle bus to the airport we had to stay overnight for the next day flight we still have not been recompensed for our expenses filled in on line and have received no replies on followups it is the usual  min or longer time to wait on customer service picking up during this trip we had to reschedule a return flight my wife was ill this should not have been a problem as the flights were rebookable we were given a voucher this voucher was only bookable by phone when i phoned to rebook we got the automated voice saying ba were not taking flight bookings by phone you can see the problem  how do a use a voucher where i must phone and they are not taking phone bookings  all i have been offered is another voucher the time to use has passed it must be great to be a business that can print endless a vouchers and not return money paid for services not rendered we returned home with aer lingus with no drama  i was told id require a  hr negative covid test for entry into philippines booked my trip via bacom with a transfer in singapore they delay my transfer to the next day okay not too bothered as have my  hr negative covid test but when i try to check in at changi airport the philippines airlines check in staff require a  hr negative covid test had to rush to a different terminal get tested wait for the result rush back to check in the gate had closed  had to book an extra night in singapore hotel book my own flight to manila then also the return journey back to london if one misses one leg of a ba booked flight the remaining flights get cancelled  i discovered oman air business class and better then british airways from treating their customers quality of service the business class experience  holidays ruined  suitcases lost in  flights i travelled from london heathrow to amsterdam with my brother before boarding we were told we couldnt take our cabin suitcases with us in the cabin so they sent them to the cargo at our arrival in amsterdam one of the suitcases was missing left at london heathrow so we had to fill in a report in amsterdam this was  days ago and we still dont have the suitcase or any information about it today i travelled from amsterdam to london city airport again they didnt allow me to board with my cabin suitcase and when i arrived in london the suitcase was missing left in amsterdam  suitcases  different flights theyve ruined my holidays no compensation no dates on when will i get my property back no information lies and more lies  i was told i could complain online and buy all the things i need shoes toiletries clothes and i might receive the money back in  days yes i might  customer service is nonexistent for over a week customer service number message said to call back in a couple weeks nothing we needed to accomplish could be done on bacom i was flying to nairobi to bring my sister back after her husband died suddenly my sister and husband had tickets on the july  from nairobi to jfk when ba received the death certificate they cancelled my sisters ticket not once but twice it took almost  weeks to correct this incompetence my niece and my wife were on the phone for hours plus hold times  times we were told by the web help number we would get a return call and no one ever called back the ticket was in premium economy when i tried to upgrade to be with my broken hearted sister the price was  plus a  service fee where is the efficiency where is the empathy where is the decency in addition to the stress of losing her husband my sister had to go through totally unnecessary stress of not having a ticket until  days before her flight also when i made my reservation i was given a price and within  seconds was told there was a  increase british airways has taken a nosedive in my opinion words simply dont convey my very deep frustration and disappointment with the company  my wife and i booked a flight in april  that included a return trip from edinburgh thru london to washington when we checked in at edinburgh airport  hours ahead of time we were informed there were no more seats available on our scheduled flight we asked how this was possible and were simply told that others had checked in online which we hadn’t done  we were instructed to come back in  hrs and  mins still with our luggage unchecked and not yet going thru security to see if we could get on the flight via standby we waited and then finally at  pm  mins before our scheduled  pm flight we were told we could be on the flight and were given boarding passes for the flight to london but no boarding passes for the connecting flight  mins after arrival time our luggage was not checked thru to washington but only to london we were told we’d get thru security on time to make the flight and it was suggested that staff would assist us when we got to security check area the line was massively long we questioned a ba staff member who said we had to get in line like the others we decided to pay  pounds to go through “fast track” security to make our flight we got to the gate in time yet due to a delayed departure caused in part by luggagespace issues on the plane our flight arrived in london  mns late and after going to the “flight connections” we were told  mins before the scheduled departure with a vague explanation of “there isn’t enough time” that we could not be given a boarding pass for our flight we were then directed to baggage claim to retrieve our luggage and then proceed to the checkin area to be rebooked for a later flight when we got to the checkin counter area a ba staff person standing at entrance to the checkin line advised us we should try to call our travel agency to rebook because the line for checking in had not hardly moved in  hrs when we finally got thru on the phone we were informed that the best ba could do for us was to get us on a flight  days later and then not to our original destination iad but to baltimore i was not told or assured i’d be compensated for this extreme expense of staying  more days in a hotel  just that i could go to the ba website and make a claim online this ugly experience still ongoing has ruined our trip to the uk   three flights london to reykjavik return and frankfurt to london generally the flights were of an acceptable standard though the seats and legroom are quite tight for a threehour flight the cabin crews were efficient and generally friendly a big plus for ba was informative announcements from the cockpit often missing on other airlines flights operated generally close to the advertised times but ba was let down by chaotic checkin and boarding procedures in preparation for each flight the number of checkin staff was one or at most two in frankfurt the lone checkin agent was also checking in business class passengers why are economy class passengers boarded from the front and not from the back this was standard across the three flights but slowed down the boarding process immensely as people seated further back tried to get past forward seated passengers stowing their enormous cabin baggage it would make much more sense to board people at the back first and to enforce baggage rules so that cabin crew are not wandering up and down the cabin trying to find overhead space for the hapless passengers who boarded last the small bottle of water and a halffull bag of crisps offered as a snack on a threehour flight to iceland was just tokenism and compared badly with what air france offered on a subsequent short flight to paris at reykjavik there was no departure lounge next to the gate  passengers had to queue wherever they could in the corridor  we left mia late due to an issue with the provisioning of the plane we arrived late and so missed our connection at lhr to cdg at lhr british airways rebooked us on not  but  flights to cdg and as such said i never took the flight to cdg and then cancelled my flight back to mia since i did not take my flight they did credit my avios for the one flight but said i never took it thus i had to book on another airline to return at the last moment trying to call ba was a nightmare on hold for over  hour a total of  extra on my calling plan only to not be helped as the person did not know what to do so he had us contact duty office who does not handle “flight only” problems feeding us back to the number we just called and we’re unable to be helped ba cost me  overall we have flown them for years reaching silver and gold status but never again they under new leadership have sunk to less than a budget low cost airline in customer service while charging premium rates  don’t be fooled  the flight was delayed over  hours and this of course caused us to missed our connection flight and change to a different route finally i lost my luggage and no one has any information i will never again travel with british airways  terrible experience with british airways i was obligated to checkin my carryon suitcase due to my group number according to the girl at the front desk then they could miss my two suitcases plus the luggage of my boyfriend who traveled with me after  days they delivered  of our  bags and since then the promise of deliver the last one persists now already  days passed and still no information of where the last suitcase is always the promise that the bag will be delivered today but it never happens no respect with the customer first and last time with british airways for sure i dont recommend at all  belfast to london on  jun  i was informed at about  flight ba has been delayed to  will only reach london heathrow at  i reached the airport at  but ba counter was only open at  at checkin counter i approached ba ground staff for advice as i have a connecting singapore airlines flight at  on the same day the reply was “it is the customer’s responsibility to contact the airline there’s nothing we can do” i was given a card with contact info on ba customer service and sales for the next  hrs in the airport i have been trying to contact ba but was told that hotline only operates from  i have to called another number for “urgent cases” which ever number i dial i just couldn’t get to speak to any one till  again i was told that there’s nothing they could do because my connecting flight is singapore airlines onboard the aircraft when i approached for help with my luggage to be placed to the compartment i was told that it’s the customer’s responsibility to do it on their own  i would think twice to take ba in the future  the customer service of british airways is really bad you cant reach any call centre agent even after waiting for  mins now i really appreciate emirates and turkish airlines after facing bas low quality customer service not only the customer service but the food they offer during a long haul ldnjnb is really low quality other airline operators which are working with doco for flight catering are way better than ba i guess ba has selected the lowest budget option from doco overall my rating is  for ba  you can feel how stingy ba is when you fly with them note respect to their cabin crew  this a new route which ba introduced at the beginning of june after several years of covid related delays the business class experience was i fear typical of the nickel  dime policies introduced by the airline over the past decade plus  helpful and friendly fa minuses  the cabin was fairly cramped with six seats across each pod had surprisingly little room with only very limited storage space it was hard to adjust the seat particularly getting it to lie flat  even the fa found it difficult the inflight entertainment was very limited with a poor choice of films tv programmes and music the food choice and quality was poor  one of the three mains was unavailable and my pea and mushroom risotto was almost inedible the cheese selection was also poor i dont know what the business class offerings from bas rivals flying similar routes are like but the experience does not match up to that provided by singapore airlines on their flights to the far east and australasia  right now do not use british airways when booking person said we would have enough time between the connection flight to final destination but he was wrong flight to london was late we auto missed our flight to edinburgh and had to wait  hours for the next flight coming back once again flight leaving was late had to run to get connecting flight then we sat on tarmac for an hour because luggage had to go on so i thought good that is probably my luggage once back in boston luggage did not show up they said we would get it within  hours and we didnt so far it will be at least  days  my son travelled alone for the first time to pursue his studies and we were very concerned about any issues he might have especially reading the reviews about the airlines but his flight was experience was good with no delays and reached toronto in time we are thankful to british airways to provide a hassle free flight to my son especially after the troubles the airlines have gone through due to pandemic unfortunately people with good experiences do not post their reviews skewing the reviews negatively the flight was very expensive though as we booked late after being dumped by air canada  swiss air after they cancelled their flight at the last moment  check in easy at bgi due to us checking flightradar and finding the flight was delayed by nearly  hours no notification from the airlines so other passengers arrived earlier easy boarding in sequence numbers seat is a joke for  hour flight no leg room on isle seat of  the seat in front frame blocks you stretching your legs and once the passenger in front reclines its even worse food is mediocre with poor choice and all of the drink choices had run out before the stewardess had arrived to my seat only choice cocacola water or red wine the connecting flight from lhr  man was cancelled with no contact from the airline i only found out trying to book a seat on the return legs with no alternative flight provided we had to privately book a taxi from lhr to manchester for  persons as this worked out cheaper than the train the outbound flight was also a farce no mention of terminal change at lhr from  to  so quick turnaround changing terminals was chaotic and stressful for older relatives travelling with us overall shocking from british airways and can guarantee i will never use them again  ba says that tickets are flexible and cancellation is free within  hrs that reality is an absolutely miserable alternative  hours after booking i need to change my flight i assume i will get a refund like their site says i will  that was apparently a lie they actually give me a voucher to request the voucher i have to sign away that i agree to the voucher despite not knowing how much money they will refund me and i might not get it for a week  i am panicked so i try calling them of course calling them does nothing the hotline says that they are too busy this happens again and again so i give up submit the request online despite no guarantee of amount or timing luckily it shows up quickly and i rebook then i need to change my booking again i go to request a voucher again this time the voucher code doesnt work on the website when i enter it so here i am needing to rebook with a useless voucher finally i call the executive class phone line which i am not a member of and then eventually pick up and agree to help me they do some thing on their back end and tell me that they will send the information to their booking department who will contact me in  hours basel to johannesburg via london cancelled connection flight confusing ui still shows cancelled booking in my bookings never sent a confirmation email for new flights  cant checkin could checkin online or via the app customer service is nonexistent busy line after min still no one there to help me check in  british airways continues to decline in customer service i used to love this airline and now i have had three poor experiences back to back regarding their customer service on the phone with flight changes and vouchers the most recent experience has cost me  more than originally booked due to bad rep advice and multiple calls to the company even as part of the executive club silver i continue to be left on hold for ages and in the last week have spent over  hours on the phone seeking support at this rate they have lost my trust  on my flight from lax to lhr i paid to pick my seat for my flight back to lax i saw the  come out of my account the next day as i’m adding in my booking the day before my flight the website tells me i no longer have a booked seat and the seat i paid for has been sold to someone else i spent an hour trying to find a way to contact their customer service and at first was told to dm the airline on twitter which i find extremely inappropriate but i still reached out anyway because i was unable to find another way to contact them on twitter i was told they were looking for an agent to help me and they never ended up responding they just left my message unread after about  hours of waiting for a twitter dm back i ended up being able to find a chat line on their website while talking to the agent on the chat line she informed me that they sold my seat to another customer and that she would book me a new seat however she was unable to tell me where the seat was or how many people were in my row after a frustrating conversation she was able to book me my original seat soon after i tried to pull up my booking in the british airways app and was unable to find it i would enter the booking reference and the site would say it was a success and the booking would show up once i refreshed the page but it did not i continued to try and add the booking and the app would do the same thing every time say it was a success then never add the booking i’m not able to find the chat line again and i will not dm a company on twitter with my support issues again i’m extremely frustrated business lounge was closed at pisa airport which was probably beyond the control of british airways but as it had been closed since january the least british airways could have done would have issued their customers who paid for this service vouchers to be used at the airport i complained about this to ba and as compensation they said they would credit my account with  avios points which i felt was an adequate compensation and at that point felt ba had handled the situation in a prompt and professional manner however that was seven weeks ago and no avios points have been added to my account i have called their call centre multiple times at one point being put on hold for an hour to put through to the right department when the phone was answered i was told it was the wrong department and to phone a number which was read out to me which was the same number i was calling this scenario has replayed itself probably about twenty times now it is clear that ba have no intention of resolving this and are just making their customer go round in circles before they give up this airline is absolutely appalling in the way it treats its customers  flew back on ba bridgetown to heathrow in the old club class a huge disappointment after going out in the new club class suites  the end of this awful yin and yang seating cant come soon enough even tried to pay bas extortionate prebooking rate for our seats  none left to choose even weeks ahead my wife and i were stuck in the middle  seats of   e and f good job it was an overnighter so we managed to sleep a bit and not have to climb over our neighbours very often the march film selection so not good not particularly friendly fa who insisted face masks must be worn even though bas policy has changed regarding flying back to a nonmask wearing destination ie london sort it out ba took off  minutes late but big tailwind so more than made up the time on a relatively smooth flight dinner not to bad but breakfast  fairly dire my wifes smoked salmon bagel was dreadful as usual when ba is good its really good but when its bad its awful i recommend hesitatingly  come on ba be great again we pay a lot for premium seats  the worst budget airline i’ve ever used far worse than ryanair and i refuse to fly with them even though they’re basically free ba charge about x as much as other budgets but have the worst service spent an hour checking in because their outdated computers crashed they left us sat on the plane for over  hours because they couldn’t connect to the internet then left  of our luggage behind because they would have had to refund everyone’s flights if they waited another  mins for the other luggage trolleys to arrive it took three days to return it and cost us £s then on return i’ve now been sat here nearly two hours and there’s no sign of our luggage again i don’t know how a company can be this incompetent but i’ll be pursuing for compensation i have some free flights from amex but i won’t be using them because it’s not worth going through this again first the actual flights are fine and the staff on all  flights zrhlhr gvalhr  lhrzrh first  in economy are absolutely fine chatty and friendly they are a credit to the company the infrastructure however is appalling zrhlhr impossible to checkin online and just  staff to checkin everyone for  flights resulting in mislabelled luggage and an hour delay to sort this out gvalhr hrs late as noone at lhr to tow the aircraft to the gate lhrzrh mins late due to slow gate staff even when you checkin online you have to queue at the airport to get the actual boarding pass there are more examples and for this reason until they sort out their stressed ground staff it is impossible to recommend this airline onboard  getting to be onboard   our main complaint is that the limited food served was bland barely edible and by far the worst we’ve ever experienced compared to other airlines used in the past the staff were friendly enough but they were rarely seen between meals no snacks were offered during the flight this is so different to every other airline we have used in the past after  hours of flying the breakfast offered was a tiny cold stale ham and cheese roll and a small plain yoghurt with a couple of oreos if ever you decide to fly with them i suggest that you bring your own food we certainly will on our return flight but will never use british airways again  feb   we show up at the airport  hours early for our flight to dublin we waited in line for  hours to just check in our luggage after that we learn our flight is delayed another  hours we had a connecting flight in london when trying to go through customs they wouldnt let us through because the boarding of the plane was going to be happening in  minutes they told us to wait in a customer service line that was well over an hour we then found out we could have gone through customs because the connecting flight from london to dublin was delayed over an hour however by the time we were told this information the doors were about to close the next available flight to dublin was  late evening with that being said we were forced to stay the night in london after talking to a british airways manager they informed us that ba would reimburse us for any hotel flight to get to dublin regardless of the airline clothes due to them losing our bags excursions and transportation due to this issue we had to spend multiple days shopping for clothes lost out on days we had booked to explore the country had to now buy an extra suitcase for the new clothes we received went  days with lost bags when we finally got home we submitted our claims like we were told to do within a few days its declined we have asked for a contact  just to talk to somebody again declined we tried to reach out via social media and we get passiveaggressive messages  they refuse to pay me back for the new flight to get to dublin transportation to and from the airport in london the hotel for london the clothes i had to buy because they lost my bags for  days and the extra luggage fee because of the extra clothes i had to buy there is no customer support and they are impossible to get a direct response from i really can’t believe they have the audacity to call this first class the check in staff at singapore were abrupt and unhelpful the official ba lounge in singapore was closed so they’re using a cheap generic alternative which anyone can pay twenty pounds to go in suffice to say it was not pleasant onboard was like being in the middle of a bad comedy sketch i can not believe the two stewardess have ever had any first class training i had to ask for slippers the first drink took nearly an hour to arrive despite only having  passengers to serve between the two of them the poor woman sat next to me ordered a wine which came filled to the brim i mean it’s first class not a student house party neither had any knowledge of the wines on the menu most of the food was awful my steak was dry over cooked and tough and whichever catering manger signed off on a canapé of soggy mushroom on top of a chunk of polenta should be sacked immediately i will say the cheese and port were nice however the worst thing was the constant galley noise there was a cart stowage immediately in front of my seat k which they were in and out of all night and appeared incapable of shutting without slamming they also seemed to have stored their personal belongings in to the bin immediately above my seat so we’re in and out of that as well i will say the seat itself is very well designed but personally i’m happy in club and would never do first again  flight took off two hours late after what can only be described as a shambles at the airport no airbridge to the aircraft which is not acceptable the aircraft was better than the outbound flight who screen was so small after serving only about rd of the cabin no first choice only a vegetarian dish or a chicken dish from the economy cabin the airline must know that vegetarians will order a meal so why include it as a choice also to offer a roll of hamcheese for breakfast after a  hour flight is cost saving a hot breakfast should be offered with only  minutes between my connecting flight due to late arrival i made staff aware whilst they let me and others passengers of the flight first there was no staff to assist in getting us to our flight it was a struggle to get my connecting flight on arriving in glasgow got txt to say my bags did not make the flight first time using ba premium and likely my last  british airways continues to go downhill we flew business class and the experience was like economy from  years ago except you can have a glass of champagne we were packed in full x seats because of it issue the day before even if weren’t the seat pitch and width is the same as economy gone are the little pretend tables in the middle seat to give some illusion of style the food was dreadful the in flight service was unsophisticated ba used to have an acceptable european business class they don’t any more other european airlines offer much better in flight experience in business class in comparison ba is taking premium and frequent flyers for granted and treating us like mugs how i miss the politeness of old ba business class from around  years ago how i used to look forward to it the small gestures like hanging up a coat giving you a hot towel having nice food being served from the galley rather than from the manky trolley covid is not the reason  this is years of cost cutting and the result is dreadful  british airways has scrapped the mandatory wearing of face masks onboard\\xa0flights although they pretend publicly that the policy remains ba from london to malaga on th february and across  visible rows around me there were  out of  passengers wearing face masks  and i was one of them this was long after the meal  drinks service had been cleared and remained like that as we landed and deplaned cabin crew were frequently up and down the aisles and not a word was said to any of these non compliant passengers or as they left the aircraft with staff bidding them farewell i guess they are too scared to remind people to follow the rules\\xa0 boarding was slow and uncomfortable on account of the lack aircon at the gate the club suite cabins were about  full but the rest of the plane cant have been much more than  occupancy whether this is the reason why cabin crew on the flight were cut to the bare minimum is hard to say but they certainly had to work hard covering multiple cabins despite that the drink and food service in business was efficient and the current policy of serving all courses at once meant that dinner was done and dusted two hours after takeoff which is a real bonus on a nighttime flight however the quality of the food remains mediocre at best and the pasta dish was almost inedible the club suite is a big improvement on the ancient cw product although storage is a funny arrangement of tiny compartments that invite losing a smartphone or two one definitely misses the drawer at foot level in old cw the large screen really improves the viewing experience and the whole ife system was much more responsive the new seats dont significantly aid sleeping particularly as theres an obvious ridge at the level of the base of the spine waking up two hours before touchdown is definitely to be recommended in order to get breakfast over and to avoid the usual queues for the toilets performance of the flight deck was up to its usual high standard and arrival was twenty minutes ahead of schedule progress through border control was speedy but baggage collection was delayed for unspecified reasons overall a good flight over the past  years i have flown with british airways twice and ended up in the exact same predicament of having to wait around all day in london heathrow for a  hour flight home to newcastle while the holidays and the plane staff are fantastic the customer service and the staff at heathrow are useless first time in february  i got stuck in heathrow due to storm ciara when travelling home from work which was not the airlines fault however the handling of the situation by the staff at the airport was a joke they had  to  staff ran a kiosk queue of over  unhappy travellers whilst they could have set up mini kiosks on the unused gates to get through everyone quicker their was no crowd control and at one point after queuing for  hours plus the staff decided to shut up shop in the end after a  hour battle i was lucky enough to get home on the last flight of the day through sheer luck when i finally spoke to someone in november  i decided to give ba a second chance and booked to go to new york since the plane landed late into lhr i missed my connecting flight which could have been avoided if the staff at heathrow had assisted me or held the plane for a short while as i rushed through customs i did manage to make it to the gate with  minutes to spare and the plane still in the terminal but since they had taken my luggage off the flight they told me to go to the service desk and refused to let me on since they had moved me on to a later flight my layover was now  hours and all i got from the guest services was a £ food voucher to spend and a phone number for what i thought was complaints but after being on hold for  minutes found out it was not from complaints considering the fact this could have all been avoidable with more assistance to have only been given a food voucher for £ seemed really cheap a few days after i got home i then raised a complaint expressing how annoyed i was and waited over a month for a response before chasing it up only to find the complaints staff were not working when i got a response i said i wanted  back off my holiday i got an apology and told the staff at heathrow will be better but in terms of good will and compensation i was offered nothing   return trip cape town to durban in club class highlighted the inconsistency our outbound trip in december was good in all respects whereas the return trip was disappointing check in was fine apart from the agent failing to label one of bags priority resulting in a long wait for our third bag the lounge was busy but no complaints we went to the boarding gate at the check in time indicated on the screen where there was no sign of activity although the screen was still showing the same gate and departure time shortly thereafter two ground staff appeared and when approached said the flight was delayed from  to  and the gate was changed to the lower level bus gates the informational screens had now updated to the delayed time and new gate i checked on the flight radar app which showed that our aircraft had started in durban and flown to cape town port elizabeth back to cape town and it had been clear for some time that it had no hope of being on time for our flight in fact looking at its schedule and turn around times it was always going to be late boarding eventually started at  with departure at   minutes late drinks service only started  minutes later followed by lunch the food was good but the wine offering very mediocre and not up to club standards with the price of good wines in south africa there is no excuse for serving poor wine lunch service was quick but then the crew disappeared behind the curtain and there was no offering of top up drinks unless specifically requested overall this was a disappointing flight with a lacklustre crew  i recently had the unfortunate privilege of travelling on british airways from detroit to bangalore and back given that it is a long and arduous journey with multiple layovers i decided to spend extra and get a business class ticket i was quickly dissuaded of any misconception that i was special because i spent that extra money or was in business class from shoddy service to rudeness and insolence from ground staff i experienced nothing but frustration and insecurity throughout my journeys the trump was being stranded in london having missed my connection and spending close to  hours to get to the front of the counter to rebook my flight being a business class traveller had no bearing as we were all told to stand in one gigantic line and wait our turn some special passengers were escorted to the club world check in when we asked the lady she told us to continue standing where we were and she would come back to get us when the counter freed up needless to say it never did finally got my turn with no extra help from any of the ground staff that was running around in a frenzy and was rebooked so i come back to the question can big corporations lie with no accountability why would i spend my hardearned money on something that gave me nothing extra shame on you british airways for your complete disregard for your passengers stop your lying or update your promises  the entertainment selection was sub par minimal selections and the new releases were  not new releases my food left something to be desired two of the seats in our row the earphone jack didn’t work the plane was either uncomfortably hot or too cold find a medium temp just overall a very basic generic airline on arrival at the warsaw airport the check in zone was the only one that was not announced on the flight board  we had to guess and ask random people where to go once we finally found the checkin desks luggage drop and checkin was appalling it took us over  hours to get our bags checked and we were half way through the queue the whole process was disorganised and very slow really the last thing you want when looking after  small impatient kids lady in warsaw airport who was supposed to direct passengers to the correct queue was useless one checkin desk for euro traveller  club europe one for bag drop and one for the checkin  flight left delayed but the pilots managed to catch up and landed with a small delay crew on the plane was nice and attentive luckily the in air experience was much better but sort out your ground service at warsaw airport after two years of being unable to fly to our second home in south africa because of covid it was fantastic to be back on board a ba flight to cpt and in the club suite seats k and k to boot these seats are a huge improvement on the old yinyang cw seats in terms of privacy ease of access and the ife screen but the cabin still felt densely occupied and the seats were just as uncomfortable when lying flat storage was a mixed blessing too with three rather fussy little compartments rather than the decent sized drawer in the old cw meaning that a laptop would have to be stored above the food onboard was woeful although serving all three courses at the same time does at least mean that the dinner service isnt dragged out cabin crew went about their business dutifully but with little enthusiasm and there were the usual queues for the toilets the flight itself was uneventful and landing was more or less on time cpt had an efficient arrangement for checking forms immediately after leaving the airbridge and there were no queues at immigration it was good to be back  i paid  for a round trip flight to london and back in premium economy they bumped me from the seat for the flight back and told me id be issued a refund instead of being issued a refund i had to contact them through several different methods phone website twitter and finally email they told me id be getting  back which is less than half of the  i paid for the upgrade instead they refunded  i emailed again and they told me id be getting  more back when i emailed again saying that that doesnt add up to the original amount i was told i was getting they simply replied with thats the final amount turns out that meant they were taking back the initial refund of  and i was only getting  total so i emailed them again asking why they changed the amount and theyve yet to respond so i called this morning and after explaining politely what i was calling for they hung up on me  first of this was one of the smoothest uk to us flights i have taken the boarding was appalling and had families with kids queue for no reason at all they called families to the front but then decided to board business and premier classes first which i appreciate why but why call families the worse seats ever and the legroom was appalling the entertainment system is basic it does not support bluetooth headphones the usb does not support your own devices for movies although the website says yes and the headphones input was as good as useless  the crew were nice so sorry i missed that  checkin very slow no app checkin and could not check my vaccine qr code online check in staff friendly but too few of them ba silver card holder and no stockholm lounge  to use boarding fine but plane was worn out seats close together and row  even worse  crew really professional and happy it seemed arrival at heathrow a total shambles ba landed at  no gate so waited and waited for  minutes then ba jetty didn’t work then ba had no steps very slow to leave plane as only moderately mobile wheelchair passengers struggle down the steps everyone was very patient and supportive but it was terrible to watch so ba skimping on lounge plane condition and gate crew good seats very uncomfortable  this whole experience was sickening over  grand spent on the holiday and their customer service is a shambles drop down menu to drop down menu not stating what i wanted to complain about would not even allow me to add tier points the flight to london was marred with problems in london we received an upgrade email to fast track and vip lounges due to amount spent this never happened and treated as paupers wherever we showed the email we had to change planes to the other side of the airfield the resort riu paradise beach was riddled with bad food drugs and bad attitude and when you complained you were fobbed off as they knew there was no ba staff to sound off too the return journey was a shambles and more delays finally arriving back at manchester completely exhausted and needing another holiday there is light at the end of this horrid tunnel virgin atlantic have just started the same route from this month now we all know this is a better option  poorly mismanaged services this time disappointed with the huge queues due to unavailability of attendants at the counters had to wait around  hours just to check in then came the boarding again had to wait at the passage for  mins finally when we thought things are better now on reaching london our next boarding pass was not scanned around  passengers including me had to wait from  am until  am for the next flight on boarding the next flight no space to keep the luggage journey was really hectic and did not expect this from ba  i booked and paid for what i thought was a business class seat on a flight to athens what i got was a premium economy seat the first nine rows were business class seats rows  to  were what should have been the premium economy cabin but had been added to the business class section which had less comfortable seats that didn’t fully recline unlike the seats in rows  to  i was in row  this is not a case of me being snobby but simply a point of principle and a clear case of ba misselling had i known prior that i would be paying the same business class price but for seats that were less comfortable than other business class passengers on the same flight i wouldn’t have booked i complained on board along with several other passengers who also resented being scammed in that way i also made a formal complaint to ba but was fobbed off apparently this is a long running scam i don’t know how they get away with it this was my first flight during the pandemic so it was understandable the difficulties facing airlines checkin was longer than normal due to the vaccine checks and passenger locator forms etc but on the return flight it was a total mess just two counters open for economy and one for business there were arguments regarding vaccine checks where two ba staff were contradicting each other it took an hour and ten minutes just to check in resulting in the flight delay on board i was not expecting great service  seating was extremely uncomfortable  inch pitch and  inch wide seats  just about bearable for an hour and a half flight  on board service was a packet of crisps and a small bottle of water from another no eye contact with me just handed out however i was pleased that disembarking passengers were let out in groups despite a few idiots who decided to stand a up to get their hand luggage out while the aircraft is was still taxing to the gate the cabin crew did manage to force them back to their seats and close the lockers  we have flown with ba for many years and never will again where there is an alternative booked and paid for club class flights didnt receive a meal or drinks onboard crew were so unorganised we were delayed on the ground for  minutes prior to departing so they had plenty of time to prepare but the inflight service was delayed once up in the air they commenced the service albeit very slowly then abandoned it and closed the service altogether the crew never even had the decency to speak to us to apologise in person or even over the tannoy  complained to ba and received an apology by email with the usual we fell short of our standards generic speech but no offer of any partial refund or avios to compensate for the lack of service   i’ve had to book six flights with ba recently all have either been cancelled or had a significant time change the latest flight was so late into heathrow we missed our connecting flight even though we’d scheduled around  hours between flights ba staff at heathrow were rude and generally clueless for the most part they couldn’t get us to our destination within  hours of our scheduled arrival time we booked an easyjet flight from gatwick instead and had to pay to get ourselves to gatwick a complaint was registered several weeks ago with no response so far perhaps ba have a backlog of complaints the way they are performing at the moment it’s an embarrassment that our national flag carrier is being comfortably out performed by budget airlines but that appears to be the case at the moment such terrible service in club world such indifference and lackadaisical attitude hardly any service everything has to be asked for and gotten asked for a cup of tea and had the flight saywhaa and then when i said cup of tea she said yesasked if wanted milk and sugar brought to me lukewarm tea with  sugar sachets no spoon or stirrer pushed the bell for stirrer and had to wait a full  mins before someone came by eventually for a spoon and had to drink cold tea seriously bawhat are you doing is this how you welcome back people to fly no check in staff for economy never experienced this before while business passengers strolled up economy passengers were left standing for  mins plus  i think british airways needs to be much clearer about what their covid travel flexibility really means because it doesnt pass the commonsense test i purchased a roundtrip business class ticket from new york toandfrom mykonos through london i traveled there with no problem the day before my return to new york though i took my covid test and learned that i tested positive i tried to call the airline on the many usless numbers they provide on their website the recorded message drones on and on about how they have no one to answer the phone because of covid safety and simply says therefore we cant answer your call try again no ability to leave a callback number or a voicemail etc for whatever reason the ba website thought that i had bought the ticket through a thirdparty agent i did not  i bought it on bacom and so wouldnt let me cancel or reschedule the flight on the web site i called and called over the coming days and could not get through to the london athens or new york lines two days later after having  negative pcr tests the most accurate test i learned i was not positive and so had to buy a new  return flight to the us ive now been calling the ba usa customer service line for nearly a month at least every other day never to get through finally did and have been told that the fact that i couldnt get on the flight because of a covid scare counts for nothing the fact they dont have enough people answering the phone counts for nothing or that i was unable to change the flight to a few days later on the web site becuase the ticket was misbooked they have offered that if i send them a greek doctors note saying that i was sick then theyll give me a voucher for a future flight from mykonos to new york i am speechless at the stupidity of this whole situation   they cancelled a flight i booked three months ago for some operational problem at a time where the prices are off the roof british airways could not give me any alternatives other than refund or a voucher   i usually avoid ba because of its appalling customer service and sneaky extra charges but this flight was my only option note that ba actually charges for seat preselection in biz class   uk pounds in this case does any other airline in the world dare do that i saved the money and waited until checkin to choose my seat for free the seats were bas universally derided cramped across backtofront configuration where you stare into the face of your seat mate an arms length away no other airline ever came up with this awkward arrangement  i wonder why no preflight drink was offered at meal time i selected one of the three main offerings only to be told it wasnt available  even though there were only  people in my  seat biz section the seat area has practically no storage except a tiny drawer at ankle level that is inaccessible when the seat is in lie flat position the bed is the narrowest i have experienced in biz class and is also very hard the cabin was very cold and the blanket very thin i had to raid blankets from two other seats just to stay warm the amenity kit is the smallest ive ever seen in biz class  it fits in the palm of the hand all in all this uncomfortable miserly experience is hardly worth the £ that ba charges for this route i used miles to pay for my ticket  but of course got whacked with bas unique and notorious fuel surcharge fee of  for using miles  i want to say a big thank you to kahina ladjouze after frustratingly missing my flight due to m road closures she helped me secure and book the next day flight without additional charges i am really grateful  i was deeply unimpressed with the lack of social distancing on my flight the plane to london was  or more full and no social distancing could be applied a number of people wearing face masks incorrectly over mouth or as a chinstrap throughout the flight and there was a fair amount of time when masks were off for the free snack small bag of crisps and ml of water  it seems crazy to allow a considerate amount of time with masks off or inappropriately worn in such a small space with no safe distance whatsoever also only the absolute minimum of service which given covid is understandable but makes the flight really boring  or not since some excitement was provided by turbulence with very little information from the flight deck disembarkation was chaotic to say the least but terminal  was empty and vast enough to allow to finally distance an upgrade for  euros one was was available but it didnt seem to make sense at least they departed on time and the plane appeared reasonably clean  london to frankfurt i made the mistake of exchanging my april flights with ba for a voucher because of the travel disruption due to the pandemic big mistake ba has failed completely and does not seem to care i tried to book an august flight using the voucher but frlights cannot be booked online using a voucher you have to wait for hours on the phone to speak to someone customer service tried to charge me twice the original cost then no email confirmation for hours after i chased it up another long wait on hold email confirmation showed they had booked the wrong outbound date  service supervisor denied any error on their part and refused to rebook for correct date or give a refund a few days later i started all over again and booked an alternative outbound date still not the one i wanted but better  and  weeks later ba cancelled the return flight so i called for a refund to be told if it hasnt appeared in my account after  days to get back in touch  things go wrong its how you deal with problems that mark out good customer service ba hasnt a clue  total rip off british airways cancels flights due to pandemic covid  when i use the voucher they issued me they want me to pay a additional  for a first class seat british airways way to rip people off and profit from a world pandemic   tokyo to london  hours without anything to eat because the sandwich i was given was inedible there was no bar service and soft drinks were pitiful with orange running out after a matter of hours total waste of money having paid for premium economy i am aware it was the beginning of the covid issues but the situation was appalling and has been made worse by a total lack of follow up service from british airways their attitude is unacceptable  it is all about money with them   at checkin desk at t heathrow was told by ba staff that sweden only allowing swedish nationals into country this was contrary to advice on swedish government website  i rang the border control office at arlanda airport they confirmed that eueftaeea  uk nationals were clear to enter the country i offered the phone to ba staff to clear up any confusion they declined and then changed their story saying it was their own company policy i spent the next hour trying to get through to ba on the telephone for a refund the calls were being disconnect due to high call volumes  ba standard of service compared to the other major european airlines was dishonest and obstructive furthermore if the other airlines can provide customer support on the telephone or via email at this time ba should be able to do the same while inflight staff at ba are still terrific they are let down by the worst sort of management bureaucracy paris to london flight cancelled due to “atc restrictions” after storm ciara  and rebooked to a later flight which was delayed on top by  hours arrived in london  hours later than planned initially and ba refused to recognise any additional expenses because it was a forceful operational reason booked  flights to italy for march all cancelled last thursday booked lgwbgylgw and next day cancelled for last week of march a month away been a gold member of ba since  and after seeing their constant downgrades i will go back with airfranceklm for my travel needs ai found thr food and seats on euro business a shame  i flew from sydney to london to visit my seriously ill mother the second leg from singapore to london was with british airways my return flight from london to sydney was with british airways leaving  february on  february it became clear that mum did not have long to live i contacted ba who said i should be able to change my return date and asked me to send medical documentation which i did with an explanatory email sadly mum passed away very early on the morning of  february i contacted ba again the next day they said because i had booked through webjet i needed to contact them i phoned them they said they would contact ba no follow up from either when i phoned webjet again they said still no word from ba when i phoned ba again they said they couldnt help at this point i gave up and booked with qantas paying for another flight bas complete lack of compassion apart from a couple of platitudes and lack of interest in helping me in any way astounded me needless to say i will never use british airways again  johannesburg to dublin via london i get to the counter and require a transit visa since when and why if you are in the same terminal even there was no support guidance or remorse from the staff i also had a non refundable hotel booking in dublin ba need to communicate such changes  ba cancelled my return flight on feb from geneva to gatwick due to storm ciara they rebooked me onto a later flight then cancelled that as well since then i heard nothing more and i was left on my own to buy a new return flight ive tried calling them several times every day but they are not answering their phones claiming they are too busy to talk to customers they cancelled my flight so i want a refund but so far there is no way of getting through to them   madrid to london i keep giving ba the benefit of the doubt but things are getting worse not better this a has cramped business class seats no middle table any more and frankly this is a pathetic premium cabin despite every statement they make about catering improvements i simply refer to meal photos on this route in  or  to see they have severely cut back on meal portions and cost iberia staff in  madrid were all very nice cabin staff okay but overall club europe is not worth the money  dont waste your money on this    las vegas to gatwick a very disappointing service for club world it felt like i was travelling in economy with attitude especially considering the very high cost of the flight ive paid half as much less for business class returns to australia we got off to a bad start when offered one third of a glass of champagne about  cm in the bottom of the glass my initial drink after take off was not what i ordered when i queried it i got a lecture on this was how it should be no wine arrived with dinner until i asked for it a second time out of stock of the first choice no second glass of wine offered yes i could have used the call button but  of a glass of champagne and one glass of wine being offered on a  hour business class flight other than the initial bottle of water and a glass of water with dinner no other water was offered until i got up and went to the galley to ask the good news is the food was good and well presented although the promised on the menu selection of pastries with breakfast were not served i later walked past the galley to see the crew eating them for their own breakfast we had dutifully filled in the preorder card for breakfast only to find we were being asked again at breakfast sleeping was impossible due to the temperature being so high i actually thought i had a fever i was so drenched in sweat until i spoke to a colleague who was the same im used to flying ultra long haul with middle eastern airlines so im used to hot cabins but this was crazy only when the crew dropped the temperature a few hours before landing presumably to wake us up was it bearable enough to sleep combined with the a very dry cabin air it was very unpleasant no need to say anything much about the eight across seating as i know the seats are being upgraded over the next few years other than they are very cramped if sitting next to a window i do like the semireclined position for take off and landing though i have fairly big shoulders and found the seat width very restrictive there is nowhere to put your spectacles or bottles of water if lying down being on the second aisle we had to join in with the economy passengers queuing to disembark so it wasnt quick at no point did any member of the cabin crew introduce themselves other than via a general pa announcement the seats i can forgive as they are being addressed but the service was budget airline level really ba you need to do much much better the ground staff in las vegas were fast friendly and efficient the lounge was something from the dark ages all s wooden panels london heathrow to bangkok done this route a few times with british airways over the years first time and probably last in economy old plane needs upgrade poor entertainment system uncomfortable seats especially for  hour flight i know they’re starting to upgrade these planes but still a long time away the only saving grace was a superb cabin staff in economy  london to los angeles take off was delayed by  hrs which we spent onboard because of a dent to the door which needed inspection  sure maybe outside of their control i was flying with my wife and two kids    sitting on bulkhead with  seats and using the baby bassinet facility after take off we saw that the inflight entertainment service for the whole section  not whole cabin was not working and we were sitting into an hr overnight flight with two little ones meaning sleeping was not going to happen we contacted the cabin crew who made zero accommodation sorry they said during the flight the cabin crew stood in the galley behind the bulkhead talking loudly while the lights were dimmed and kept slamming drawers as they moved things around to cap it off we landed at pm et and they had left behind our baby car seat and stroller we finally received them back  days later conclusion never fly ba again  british airways comair johannesburg to cape town route is never less than fully subscribed and on this occasion the equivalent of club europe stretched back  rows service followed the usual pattern of a drink champagne included and comair’s idiosyncratic ‘fourcourse meal’ ie a tiny salad a hot course that one could see before choosing a minute iced cake and a minuscule cheese  biscuits the hot meal is invariably scorched around the edges comair really need to move with the times to a more modern business class offering aside from the meal the flight was typically efficient with arrival slightly ahead of schedule  fly economy and you’ll be paying more for an awful service the london to vancouver route uses old planes the oldest inflight entertainment systems and my food was inedible  my partner and i spent christmas in tokyo the flight over was enjoyable the staff were polite and helpful and it all ran smoothly our experience back home was completely different the staff were incredibly rude and lazy the flight was  hours and mid flight my partner asked for a bottle of water the lady very rudely said she was going the other way and that my partner could head to the back and help herself my partner headed to the back where there were two more ladies sitting and when requested they pointed to a shelf my partner got the water from both our tvs stopped working mid flight also for a period of  minutes we asked the staff if they could fix the problem the lady said she would try while sighing as  year olds deciding on which airline brands to remain loyal to i can tell you british airways will not be it terrible customer service  los angeles to london heathrow if i could give ba a zero stars i would they have the worst customer service i’ve flown many airlines around the world with my family but surely we will never fly with british airways again they gave our seats away on the return flight and would not address this after purchasing expensive business class tickets  months in advance to ensure that our family flew  hour flight together the flight to london didn’t have the best service most toilets were out of service the beds in business class are the most uncomfortable of all business class i’ve flown the checkin process at heathrow was disastrous the most inefficient process with no human assistances the limited ones available were all slammed with line of customers i would highly suggest you refrain from using this carrier i wish i would have done a bit of research prior to flying with them  new york to london i was on the last flight out at  pm and this is clearly the cheaper version in all respects  the boeing  certainly showed its age ife screen was tiny seat was well used the flight time was quick  hours and thats about it fa is highly professional to the point of being unfriendly to me the f b was standard and not taken as i had eaten something earlier im a one world emerald and the cabin manager did not greet me its a small touch and in the grand scheme of things means little but is an acknowledgement that you spend time and money with that carrier usually followed by a drink or two   austin to london along with an  purchase price for each of two roundtrip tickets for my wife and daughter ba charged an additional  for seat reservations to ensure they sat together when they went to check in those seat reservations in both directions had been given away and family had to sit in different seats back home i applied for a refund of the  seat fee and was told there was no proof i paid for them i have credit card charges and email confirmations clearly stating these charges were made but there is no process to upload those documents to ba  heathrow to belfast great service in belfast but absolutely shocking in t at heathrow very rude check in staff when told we had to print out boarding passes and also for our suitcases totally disgusted cabin crew were lovely on the  flight to belfast on th december  johannesburg to london the recently refurbished first and club world lounge at jnb has failed to resolve the congestion when passengers from the two evening flights to lhr descend on it theres more table space for eating and the food has improved but poor acoustics mean intrusion on privacy crying babies and facetime calls add to the restless maelstrom of human activity boarding was reasonably quick although there was the usual confusion about group queues the predominantly young mixed fleet crew were competent but lacked finesse and kept on getting drinks orders muddled the meal service took ages because of some unidentified problem with heating the main course the food itself wasnt at all bad  when it was finally served the cabin temperature wasnt too hot and we both slept quite well arrival was ten minutes ahead of schedule and baggage collection was quick overall a good flight despite the aged club world product  san francisco to oslo via london the head support was damaged so i had to sit  hours leaned forward the flight from san francisco was delayed so i missed my connecting flight in london to oslo i came first to the ba counter but received a new flight  hours  minutes later rude staff gave me a voucher for  gbp  london to sydney via singapore i would like to express my thanks and appreciation to the staff at the bag drop centre at heathrow when i lost my passport on thursday evening st november they spent nearly  hours trying to locate it and it was eventually found  mins before my flight was due to leave a big thank you to you all i would also like to thank the cabin crew on flight basingapore to sydney  november who were so kind after i was taken ill during the flight i was looked after so well  lisbon to london i pay extra to check my bag to ensure i am not using more than my share of overhead space to have british airways charge me  euros to check a bag to my final destination and then insist that my briefcase be put under the seat in a cramped aircraft to ensure there is room in the overhead bin for travelers too cheap to check their bags is an insult will never fly ba again  ba operate daily shuttles from london to glasgow its a busy route and im sure make money plus there is no competition however ba flights are rarely on time and the fee paying passengers are fed stories about the aircraft was delayed enroute from some far flung exotic location because i have several buses and trains to catch after i reach glasgow punctuality means a lot to me and not a lot to ba hence im very disappointed with the service they provide  london to vancouver i used to fly this aircraft and route for many years until it was no longer priced competitively i flew on the th and it was a remarkably bad experience food service was very poor in most aspects i had the chicken tandoori which was far too spicy for most palettes no drink was offered with the meal which was astonishing rather tea and coffee an obviously far cheaper offering was supplied soon after the dinner tray was handed i had to ask twice for a beer before it was deliveredthis then put me out of sync with the service the one time yes one time offer of tea and coffee was then obviously missed by me completely service itself was not good with no warmth or hospitality on a hr flight engagement is pretty critical our hostesshost seemed to be only interested in those sitting in the extra legroom seats and essentially ignored everyone else the cold snack was a cold tasteless sandwich just prior to landing the entertainment system is a joke as it is so old i had become so accustomed to a normalnewish tv screen that i was blown away that this system was still in place the screen size was the equivalent of your phone’s no music selection worth talking about so i just used my ipad on this or similar routes i have flown air canada westjet virgin atlantic air transat ba was by far the worst and some of those airlines are budget in nature and offer paid meals only i cannot believe that the mighty ba offers such a terrible product in  i will spend more to fly better and actively avoid ba on long haul the flight departure was delayed due to what the captain described in his announcement as a mix up with paperwork disembarkation was delayed due to what he also described as a mix up with landing bridge allocation so the plane had to taxi around the runway until a gate was found we missed our connecting flight the staff in purple at the airport who are supposed to help passengers find connecting flights didn’t know what to do we ended up being shunted onto another flight resulting in a four hour delay all of this inconvenience is due to ba’s incompetent management my seat would not recline and the food was just carbohydrate filigree the flight attendants are rude it used to be a good airline  london to san francisco return in economy the seats are small outbound was bearable because there was an empty seat between the two of us but returning no empty seat and it was horrible im only  and female but couldnt lean down to the seat in front of me to collect my belongings if you want to get anything from your bag below the seat in front of you you will need to do some major maneuvering touching the person next to you throughout the flight is unavoidable i flew on a  both ways they no longer have any air vents you can adjust so both flights got stuffy and warm i had to ask them to turn up the ac both ways i was literally sweating economy is small with the aircraft mostly made up of business class asian vegetarian meal was good as usual although the breakfast was terrible asian vegetarian breakfast in economy plus is much better i will find an alternative airline for my long haul flights its not worth it  zurich to london return both legs travelled with hand luggage only and i could not choose a seat without paying fair enough but when there are  empty rows either side of  strangers cramped into one row and not allowed spread out as they had not paid the premium price seems mean to say the least hand luggage fares are last to board make them uncomfortable on board no free food nor drink london to malaga a terminally ill airline packed with clueless staff full of attitude at the checking at gatwick airport i was told the flight might well be delayed of h as not departed yet from malaga sms confirmed the delay without a new time of departure and provided a link for flight status at gatwick there are no arrivaldeparture boards prior to security for me to check if the flight was on time as shown online when asked the ba guy at the lounge kiosk he said i could check the link provided or go through security where monitors are surprisingly the flight was on time and no text was sent for an update at the gate we were told the aircraft was replaced no apologies from anyone neither ground nor on the flight we boarded at  pm and took off at  stiff and no recliner seats cabin crew are so sociopathic and full of attitudes  additional seats are replacing the  toilets located at the back of the  and located at the very far end of the aircraft in the cabin crew storage room and working space is horrible low cost service for a flag carrier ticket price  buenos aires to london heathrow rwturn the aircraft is very old cabin configuration is very old and tired ife screens have not been changed since they were first installed my ipod has a larger and more responsive screen before taking off in buenos aires some pax but not all were offered water or orange juice i never got any after take off drinks were offered followed by a hot meal food choices ran out in the first row seats were uncomfortable footrests were jammed on the return flight sparkling wine and water were offered before take off followed by drinks and the meal i had chosen online was a beef stew with mashed potatoes poor movie choices miniature screen and uncomfortable seats crew ok no indication as to which toilets to use either forward in business class or rear economy having flown norwegian on their b in their premium cabin on the same route ba is a waste of my money   johannesburg to amsterdam via london after many delayed departures they announced that the flight was cancelled and rescheduled to depart the following night at pm the following night at  pm they announced further delays due to the same technical fault reported  hours previously finally departed at pm consequences were missed connecting flight to amsterdam we also had to pay for our no show at our hotel in amsterdam and when trying to claim this charge from ba they declined but offered to pay for our taxi arrived in amsterdam  hours later what really annoyed us was the lack of communication and disorganized manner on how the events were mishandled once on board the crew were really nice and just as we were getting new hope this was shattered by the terrible food and on board entertainment that was outdated our connecting ba flight back home was the same thing and on arrival we were delayed on disembarking  one of the reasons we traveled club class was because ba have lounges where you can get away from the usual airport chaos and screaming children ba don’t tell you there is no lounge at kos airport limited seating very noisy limited facilities not sure i will spend so much on air tickets with them in the future if they don’t warn of limited facilities it doesn’t help that the flight is delayed by an hour the start of our journey back from from efl was inauspicious with hundreds of delayed and stranded passengers crammed into the departure lounge awaiting flights on airlines other than ba as it was weather in the uk plus air traffic control issues meant that departure was delayed by  minutes once airborne in a refitted a complete with a nice fresh leather smell cabin crew in ce were friendly and efficient and the food including a cod dish was quite reasonable it was interesting to note that the refit hadnt extended to the toilet which was looking distinctly worse for the wear a big plus on the flight  and a first for me  was wifi which actually worked and was quite fast  although at a cost of £ for an hours use i thought it was meant to be free for business class passengers but evidently not landing made up for some time but we were parked right in the middle of nowhere because of a backlog of flights however ba had laid on a separate bus for ce passengers and we were out of the airport  minutes later so not too bad all in all chicago to zurich via london delays after delays the flight was supposed to depart at  pm chicago time but was scheduled at  pm we waited a long time at the airport finally at  pm we managed to board on the a for my first time but the legroom was horrible the ife completely unfunctional and with no food served during the taxi a technical problem occurred and we returned to the gate in the end the plane took off at  am chicago time and we arrived in london heathrow at  pm we had to wait  hours for boarding for another  minutes delayed flight we arrived in zurich on an old a at  pm zurich time instead of the original  pm very stressful at least the staff were nice  i wouldnt even rate them   x business class passengers booked via on business  bag lost in transit ground crew in mxp rude dismissive  most unhelpful unable to locate missing bag waited for next flight to arrive still no bag decided to cut short our trip as the bag contained essential meds  ok thats a lesson learnt the hard way due to this being an ob booking ba customer services unwilling to be flexible and change tickets resulting in full fare tickets purchased to return apparently the bag arrived hrs later we were back in the uk despite ba website showing in transit lhrmxp for  days numerous lengthy calls to customer service proved fruitless passed from one department to another then cut off after an email to their ceo  director of brand and customer experience received a call from global engagement executive team offering £ evoucher abysmal customer services no wonder their reputation is in tatters i will never fly ba again  hong kong to london an email on the th august advising us that this flight was cancelled and the hours spent on hold never speaking to anyone what a total awful nightmare then the email at pm saying i must be delighted to find out my flight has not been cancelled all slots in the elemis salon were already booked so no massages were available in first class arriving at hk airport on the return journey and struggling even to get from the pavement to the inside of the terminal why did they not tell us to print out proof of travel we had to wait ages for ba to open a check in desk pretty average food and service in the qantas lounge a broken screen in seat a it would not stay in position and without wedging unusable to constant interruptions during the flight to my partner from a large passenger climbing over him a ghastly sweet and sour chicken main course which made me send my tray away and not eat until after leaving the flight cheapest goodies bag with the broken zip and my suitcase was the very last off the plane i had already been to the ba desk and reported it when it then eventually turned up on the conveyor belt first class out to hk was a good business class experience the return flight in business class was in a word poor the plane was tired ife faulty poor food and the journey was only saved by the quality of the staff they were lovely  but if you give them rubbish tools they will serve rubbish the night term pantry offering was a total joke i have been a ba exec card holder since for ever and i have seen is a decline in the service level certainly not value for money we did not get a club class experience on the flight home  gatwick to seville when my son and his girlfriend proceeded to drop their hand luggage a member of staff insisted in making them pay gbp because one of the suitcases was cm oversize and he insisted that it was not a hand luggage staff said that if he did not pay he would lose the flight mahe to stockholm via london checked in online before the flight but had to do the bag drop was met by a rude lady at first class check in and the process took about  minutes don’t know why no apology the boarding was in time the welcome wasn’t especially friendly just pointing the direction where to go the club europe cabin felt claustrophobic i had a window seat the csm never came to say hello the service was pretty basic ok during the meals but self service between no drink service if you didn’t ask on the flight to stockholm the purser introduced himself to all emerald members the service was limited due to the strike next day but friendly the seating was terrible on this a so tight i have to say travelling in club europe is a waste of money the food was no better than economy food from the past the seats are just the same as in economy although you get a middle tray and probably worst of all the cabin was full of a lot of arrogant people who thought that just because they were not in economy it somehow made them more worthy people this might be a british trait as i’ve travelled business class on other airlines and not had the same experience  london to glasgow ba customer service is unquestionably the least helpful least accommodating least friendly and least responsive so called service available they clearly train their staff in the multitude of ways to frustrate their customers i will try to avoid this airline from this point on   british airways flight to brussels from heathrow check in problems and a hugely delayed flight pay premium prices for a below average service they need to invest in their it systems and greatly up their game  london city to ibiza disappointing all the flights were cancelled without explanation  presumably because the striking staff didnt turn up so trip was ruined got a replacement ticket for a different destination on a different week trip was basic the meal consisted of two small shortbread biscuits british airways is now firmly in the bucket airlines easily beaten by easyjet  calgary to london staff were not in high standards looked rushed and not polite did not look professional enough in our flight back to london staff were laughed and just chilled very loudly in back of the aircraft there was not welcome snacks we sat in the very last row and food choice ended only chicken was our option to have very sad and staff did not care about this situation  what happened to a great airline got to heathrow  hours before flight and start queuing and at one point there were only  operators and then after  minutes a rd appeared  minutes later a ba guy asks for vegas travellers and then asks us to go toba different line to rush things through there was  operator on this line and it took another  minutes waited over  hour on the tarmac as we has missed our slot due to late boarding got to las vegas and waited at baggage claim for over  minutes no bag got to ba desk to be told luggage missed plane and there should have been  members of staff at bag claim to tell us no apology just a shrug of shoulders during day receive offers from ba to upgrade to club class and i try at least  times to book but website does not process speak to ba at st offer to be told offer finished despite the web advertising get through to manager who admits the ba website is the worst and advises to keep trying book in online for return and web accepts the  bags stated on web as  bags ring ba and they say go to airport and speak to a member of staff get vegas  hours early to make sure plenty of time to sort and find out there are no ba staff available in the whole airport until  hours before flight what a useless organisation i must state staff on plane very good heathrow to marseille within a few days of booking a flight for december ba advised flight has been changed to late evening arrival this is unacceptable so i opt to cancel and full refund ba then says it is refunding the fare and makes no mention of the fee i have paid for seat selection i have found a claim form for refund of these fees on submission they say they will take up to  days to think about it  frankfurt to london ba staff watched while security went through partners bag for around  mins it required a call to police who sauntered up and stared at the bag for a while  actually just clothes when they were finishing the flight dispatcher closed the flight only  minutes required much longer spent unloading my luggage we had checked this bag in almost  hours previously and arrived at security in plenty of time ❎ london to olbia complete confusion the plane was delayed getting to sardinia and so we waited but following checkin at sardinia we were penned into long lines no seats extreme heat and no water in the queues the airport staff in sardinia appeared to be overwhelmed finally got onto the plane and we’re now delayed on the tarmac we are due to depart more than  hours after our scheduled departure time but so far still stuck on the tarmac with few updates no water provided i felt unwell but was told they had no glasses so nothing to drink numerous small children with no hydration and high temperatures after a second time of asking i was told i could buy a drink once we took off but they have no idea when that would be they need to abandon the flight at this stage before more people become unwell cabin crew just standing there doing nothing but looking perplexed  barbados to gatwick we boarded a half full flight and whilst preparing for take off the video was shown as normal the crew participation side of it seemed like trouble to the crew once inflight the drinks service got under way and service was very quick i had a beer and my partner a soft drink i was given a room temperature can and no drinking vessel and my partner her soft drink and the standard plastic cup no mention of ice within  minutes the meal service commenced they got to our seats which were  from the back of the aircraft and when we were served two trays appeared and passed to us i enquired what the meal was and we were both told pasta it’s all we have left everyone else had a choice of chicken or pasta my partner refused her pasta and i proceeded to challenge why on a half filled flight they had run out no tangible answer came back but was very rudely told she would get chicken from premium economy i said only one was required as i would eat the pasta glad i did i think chicken was placed on my partners tray it was burnt during this service no further drinks were offered except for water trays were gathered and that was the last we saw of the crew for  hours they reappeared about  minutes before landing served a box containing stale bread with processed cheese and a stale cake i politely refused the offering and my partner ate the bread tea and coffee was served  our flight out  days previously was the exact opposite pleasant staff food standard but acceptable the only other negative was the musical chairs played by fellow passengers the crew turned a blind eye the positives the ife has a wide choice and we got home safely and getting off the aircraft was a pleasure as it was also the coldest flights i have ever been on  heathrow to kalamata heathrow t to kalamata greece th june and return  week later used avios points to upgrade to exit row seats for more legroom bad news  took off   hours late from heathrow delays to previous incoming flight but made up about  hour on the journey out also left kalamata about  hour late on our return but landed virtually on time seats much more comfortable with more padding than for example ryanair or jetcom so with the extra legroom the flights were pretty comfortable expensive or course ms offerings for food but tasty enough pleasant fas so all in all decent flights havent used ba for short haul for quite a few years but would use again if the price was right london to seoul nightmare experience with british airways almost constantly my business cabin is downgraded to economy at the last minute with a  hours longhauls flight lounge simy sucks cheap noisy and croweed multiple malfunction items on the aircraft including unfolded table given the price it charge certainly one of the worst airlines one can possible take ❎ newcastle to delhi via london at checkin  i was charged for carrying  kilos extra which is of no problem i paid a total of £ for  kilos on my flight from london to delhi during boarding i asked for water to which the attendant told she would get but she was busy as customers were boarding the flight i then  asked for a bottle of water  which she seemed to forget   hours into the  journey my inflight entertainment system got stuck on the tv and radio feature when the dinner was served ithe meal consisted of chicken gravy and mash along with bread butter and a mousse delays caused by british airways resulted in the flight reaching delhi late and me missing my connecting flight but as i landed at delhi and picked my baggage from the belt a british airways staff was ready with another ticket from delhi to mumbai without me even asking   gatwick to madrid when i arrived i waited for one and a half hours for my one suitcase it didn’t arrive  i was asked to fill in a ‘lost luggage’ form which i did and given a number to call the next day the representative said she’d make sure the suitcase was delivered by  pm i was out during the day when i returned later that evening there was no suitcase it hadn’t been delivered the next morning sunday i phoned the number again the answer message said phone back on monday as i was leaving on sunday night this was pointless i was leaving madrid at  pm my one suitcase arrived two hours before i left madrid so i spent the whole time in madrid without my medicines change of clothes toiletries etc which ended up wasting a lot of my short valuable time buying essentials that i needed whilst there  my boyfriend and i wanted to return from our trip to london a day early but the ba app and website continued to glitch so i called to ask how much it would be to leave a day earlier i was told that the penalty fee for changing the flight is  each and there’s a  fee for them to do it over the phone that’s  and the price of a flight by itself we decided to try our luck again changing it on the app and paid  to change our flight to one day earlier to make it back for an event the flight was delayed and arrived hr  mins late we missed our event the plane was filthy and my tv didn’t work i asked the flight attendant for something to clean the slimy finger smears off the screen with and she told me it’s normal wear and tear but i could get toilet paper from the bathroom i called to ask for a refund for the fees since the flight was delayed but they told me they can’t give us a refund because we got on the flight  london heathrow to dubai last sunday we unfortunately missed our ba flight to dubai due to unforeseen circumstances so we booked the next available flight for the morning which was with emirates today we arrived at dubai airport expecting to board the flight home that we had already paid for months in advance at check in the ba staff told us that our flight had been cancelled as we missed our outgoing flight we have not received a refund for the seats and they have refused to refund us the tickets we had brought   johannesburg to london i booked a seat without luggage firstly one cannot make one booking for two passengers if only one has luggage this caused an issue when trying to seat together when the passenger without luggage tried to move seats normally a free option for standard seats you get advised that you have to pay this was not disclosed when the booking was made it was irritating because one of us was ill  inverness to auckland via singapore with british airways service was very good but comfort was very bad for a  hour i had no more leg room than i did for an hour flight i was uncomfortable and as a regular flyer i have used other airlines that provide much more space for long haul flights  i paid an extra £ for two premium economy seats on this long haul flight and was very disappointed the seat felt small and was shabby the tv screen was small and very dark i tried to adjust it but it was still unwatchable the whole experience was very poor not premium in any way the return flight was a code share with japan airines which was premium a whole different experience i would be happy to pay for their premium seats i would advise avoid british airways premium economy as it is far from premium i felt a complete waste of £  london to shanghai the most disappointing business class i have flown in a long time the plane was old worn and dirty there were crumbs of food on the seat and the floor from a previous flight it took  hours to for drinks service to reach my seat after take off  the food followed shortly which was over cooked they seemed to be short on staff however what made me really angry was that there were people in the cabin who had had both drinks and food and were having their beds turned down before i’d even been offered a drink the service was exceptionally poor i am flying home tomorrow and am not looking forward to the flight as a gold card holder you might have thought ba would check their frequent fliers are being looked after i’ll return to using other airlines in the one world group for my long haul trips such as cathay jal or finnair the only reason that i’ve given more than one star is that i managed to sleep quite well  the bedding and pillows were good ultimately though  sorry ba not good enough  london to doha similar to our outbound flight the seats are comfortable but behind the competition very small storage area  if you are tall try sleeping sitting up or in the cradle position as the bed is just not long enough the food portions seems like you are forced to go on a diet though the taste was ok the entertainment system had the worst selection of any airline i have flown lately  but their check in baggage policy makes them a very attractive option when you see what their opposition charges for excess luggage  larnaca to london this a is totally unsuitable for a flight of this length the seat pitch and width are the same for economy and club having paid € for my flight its disgraceful on flight where you are sitting for more than  hours in an expensive club europe seat the personal space is so tight if the person in front reclined their seat its a nightmare the seat in the middle is blocked but getting out if the seats in front are reclined is hazardous  you pay for a club ticket for space and comfort and get nothing   st lucia to gatwick on which my wife and i were both involuntarily downgraded from premium economy to economy due overbooking on the flight it should be noted that at no time was there any announcement for volunteers for downgrading at vieux fort airport i now know from your cabin crew that it is normal practice for appeals for volunteers to be put over the tannoy system before any enforced downgrades at the time of going through the baggage hall getting our boarding passes we queried them as none had seat numbers on them to which we were told to just to go through security and our seats would be allocated when we went through the departure gate once in the departure lounge all four of us were tannoyed to return to the baggage hall when we were then told that my wife and i were being downgraded to economy the male telling us this more or less indicated this was the only way we would be getting on the flight giving us £ per each on a prepayment card as compensation under article  of ec  stating however that this did not affect our statutory rights he then told us he would find us in the departure lounge and then all four of us had to go through security once again the male who we spoke to in the baggage hall did not come and find us we had to go and find him when he also told me that he had put my wife and i on a row with no other passengers which we assumed rightly or wrongly was so we could not tell people sitting beside us about the poor service we had received from ba however two other passengers did come and sit beside us with the passenger sitting beside my wife telling her this was because the seat they had been allocated was soaking wet and smelt of urine and the cabin crew had asked them to sit on it with a cushion which they had refused and so they were given the seats next to us which was no problem what further concerned me even more was one of your cabin crew walking past another passenger with their seat in the reclined position on three separate occasions just prior to approaching gatwick and after the pilot had requested seat belts on and seats in upright positions never telling the passenger to raise their seat ba’s latest advert celebrates  years of ba but for me their service is going backwards the music that accompanies the advert is called ‘salvation’ and by the end of the flight my wife and i were surely seeking it article  of ec regulation  is worth reading if this happens to you  chicago to london cancelled flights just a few hours before i left home then put me on a different flight which would have made it impossible to make my connecting flight was finally put on a different flight on the way home because my first flight was through american airlines and the second through british airways all in the same booking i was only able to check in and get a seat on the american airlines flight as i was redirected every time to their website couldn’t check in for the british airways flight so had to have a middle seat which is very uncomfortable i always check in  hours before to guarantee a seat but ba wouldn’t allow me to do this  san francisco to london after paying £ for flights which i had to cancel they wouldnt allow any change of dates or change of name and after all that wouldnt give me the  avios points because i wont be on the flight  new york to venice via london staff have been nice when around but aircraft food assistance and information all deplorable booked business class first flight overnight from jfk to heathrow  quick mediocre food service then gone chair is set up so i’m staring at a stranger it’s uncomfortable and difficult to maneuver with no instructions didn’t wake me for breakfast not sure why they had me fill in a form for when i wanted to be woken up no instructions for the transition between ba flights now i’m on the flight from heathrow to venice no offer of coffee water but worse business class is just coach class no extra leg room just  seats with the middle one blocked out person in front of me put their seat back and my knees are in my chest i didn’t pay for international business class to get stuck in uncomfortable seats for  long flights i won’t fly ba again   doha to london heathrow flight on time not completely full had an aisle seat near back of plane without the entertainment box in the way some reviews say that the last few windows are blanked off at rear of the aircraft but not so on this plane breakfast was served which was ok cabin crew mixed mostly young and worked quickly crew uniform still looks a bit tatty compared with rivals in this part of the world there is good and bad still with ba  bad was the so called chicken wrap served just before arrival  leathery and inedible  why do they let themselves down with such a poor offering  hardly any passengers near me could eat it bad was that there was an old tissue and food wrapper in my seat pocket good was the newer aircraft and the breakfast has improved arrived on time at heathrow but to a remote stand san diego to london from the moment that i boarded this flight due to take off at  the crew had one interest and one only  to get the cabin lights off which they duly achieved two hours later as a consequence the service was negligent in the extreme this was a club world ticket  so expensive and i looked forward to a decent level of service however i wasnt offered champagne on boarding wine with my meal or coffee and port after my meal i complained to ba when i got home but they werent interested and i was met with a barrage of corporate platitudes this flight was a disappointing end to what had been a great trip to the us  mexico and has left me with a very poor view of the airline flown with british airways on numerous occasions with no issues however on this occasion my baggage was lost on arrival at gatwick there was no british airways representative at the baggage claim however there was a phone that allowed me to call the baggage department reclaiming lost baggage was simple and my bag was put on the next flight to singapore which i received the following day edinburgh to bangalore via heathrow rude staff poor service missing baggage poor entertainment system i spilled my drink and the attitude of the staff was brutal i apologised for my clumsiness but i was made to feel like i had deliberately done some shameful act in public and staff would not want to have anything to do with me i asked for tissues and the answer was get it from the toilet the staff did not even have the courtesy to ask me if i needed another drink once i cleaned myself up the crew were also extremely noisy chatting and laughing loudly at the pantry place for the entire duration and then  while boarding at edinburgh they offered to check in my second bag for free because cabin was full the staff wrote bangalore via heathrow but my bag was not loaded to connecting flight  hours gap mind you   whatever happened to the worlds favourite airline returning from bermuda to gatwick we were presented with a wornout boeing  my seat table was broken with bits of seat plastic hanging off i had to try and balance the seat tray on my knees so that the dinner tray could be kept flat it didnt work tray ended up on the floor with drinks and food reported this to steward who was clearly upset with my complaint and told me ill put it in the book no apology no attempt to explain just irritation from him the food was awful neither my wife or i could finish it it also seemed incomplete with no cheese and biscuits and nothing to go on the salad my wifes entertainment screen didnt work the passenger next to me screen didnt work and mine only worked intermittently it look liked something from the arc with the grid allowing the touch sensitivity clearly visible i believe the s out of gatwick are being updated cant come a moment too soon we purchased premium economy tickets for the this flight we didnt get a premium service initially i was going to buy business tickets but the price was ridiculous so im glad i didnt my frustration with ba grows every year we only fly with them now when we have too london to miami worst long haul business class that annoying divider the ridiculous fold down footstool and the worn out seats the service is nonexistent unless they are serving you the meal if you want a snack or drink get out your seat and hunt down a cabin member they don’t ask you if you need anything between meals the toilets are dirty and basic i’m a gold member but giving it up to fly other more updated airlines they’ve crammed as many business class seats as possible at the expense of comfort and it’s not like they’re cheap  barcelona to new york via london i was in barcelona for just four days so had one small bag which they asked me to check my flight from barcelona to london was delayed causing  passengers to miss their connections when i finally got a flight we taxied for an hour and then were told we needed to return to the gate as the luggage was loaded incorrectly it took me nearly  hours to travel from barcelona to jfk  when i arrived my luggage wasnt there so i filed a claim i called and emailed every day and they couldnt find it even though i had a tag number and and documentation eight days later they finally contacted me and gave me a six hour window for bag delivery the final insult is that i was expected to file a claim for my missing personal property within seven days as a result they have offered me no compensation for damages   i forgot i had purchased a hand baggage only fare at the airport i was charged more than  euros for my bag which came out as almost as much as the fare itself cost the staff at checkin could not have been less helpful the whole experience was of a bad lowcost airline boarding process saw me in category  having to board last not so much as a glass of water is offered the seats have very little legroom and just one toilet for the a economy cabin   london to berlin scheduled for st december on approach to the airport i got a message saying that my flight was canceled no explanation was given as i arrived at the airport staff acted very confused and said their rerouting center is closed for the evening due to issues and if i wanted to travel in the next days ahead of christmas i should book my own travel with another airline or train company eg eurostar my costs would  be reimbursed the airport staff also said no further help from british airways is available on the day to due airport issues i felt the only way out was to rebook myself with a different airline for a hefty  gbp fare for a short haul flight for the next day as it was christmas prices were very high after i arrived at my destination a lengthy exchange of messages with british airways started and british airways said in the end they do not compensate costs for rerouting with a different airline opposite to what their airport staff said on the day of cancellation   our return journey from sydney to london which was approximately  hours in duration with a stop at singapore airport was faced with one major issue we flew economy class with a two year old whose inflight entertainment headphone socket wasn’t working having paid £ for our two year olds ticket you would except the inflight entertainment to be working on such a long flight having complained to the cabin crew they did their best but unfortunately the socket could not be fixed we were offered to move seats to the only  seats available however there were three of us so this was not practical the cabin crew gave us some first class goodies including a bottle of champagne for the inconvenience caused and they also said that all they could offer us in monitory terms was £ they said they would contact ba customer services on our behalf to complain and to expect more compensation than what the crew could offer us by the time we had got off the plane and were in baggage claim i had already received an email from ba cs and that they would respond within  hours which they did however all the could offered was a £ voucher to use on another ba flight i replied declining this and said this was as insult to what we had originally paid for the flight and explained what the cabin crew had said i also said i had no intention of booking any foreseeable flights with any airline therefore an evoucher is worthless to me there was no other alternative or any means of reasoning the flight was basic and the seats were uncomfortable ba also offer wifi on the plane but when you try to use it they charge £ per hour in economy class  gatwick to tenerife this aircraft either needs a refit or needs retiring gmedk is by far the most uncomfortable plane i have ever been on i paid extra for an extra leg room seat  a because i always feel happier without my knees under my chin for a four hour flight i reckon it was no more than half an hour into my flight that the total lack of padding on the seat turned this flight into an ordeal it was like sitting on concrete i would imagine that when this aircraft was new  i believe the leather seating was quite yielding and comfortable but now with thirteen years of backsides compressing the padding it was dreadful i took the precaution of changing my seat for the return and sneaking on a seat pad purchased in lanzarote which coupled with there being no passengers next to me made the flight in f a little more bearable staff were fine on the outward leg but a little tired by the time i returned at night ten days later i normally travel easyjet on this route but on this occasion i used some avios to make the flight less expensive easyjet offer two trolley runs but only  on these ba flights with their diminishing attitude to customer welfare i will not use ba on any lengthy flights as the service and comfort offered by easyjet is in my experience far superior\\r\\n  booked a flight through expedia for june  from denver to paris via london on the promise that i could upgrade using avios after booking the flight and trying to upgrade was notified that i could not upgrade the flight due to how i purchased the ticket paid about  for early seat selection on both flights after buy up to the front of the plane was notified that my seats were changed to the back of the plane with no explanation  but found out they gave the seats that i paid extra for to another party could request a refund but wouldnt honor what they had sold me in the first place they would not honor a refund either then i became ill and they chose not to refund my fare of  plus paid for upgrades   johannesburg to london i had a bulkhead seat on the upper deck the only advantage is that nobody will step over you during the night ba has been using the same configuration of seats in business for the last  years and it is time for them to step up their game if they want to keep people flying with them the business class seat is not wider than the premium economy seat the difference is that it goes to a full bed there is no room or to put down a glass other then taking out the table as it was a late flight pm the crew decided not to offer predinner drinks i ordered the quick meal option in order to get more sleep big mistake you only get the appetiser tiny and the desert even smaller i was still hungry and they refused to serve me my main dish as they reserved it for the crew the trays are removed when everyone else finishes so much for getting more sleep the crew never came back until breakfast that flight was a total disappointment  cape town to london very unimpressive amenities and service unless you have a bulkhead seat there is no way to leave the seat without either stepping over someone or having them step over you there is a small storage drawer but nowhere to stow even small carryon baggage except in the bin above the food was at best pedestrian and no wine was served with dinner except by request and then it took ages to get my husband got no cutlery on his tray and couldnt get the attention of steward to rectify i gave him one of the two sets on mine i on the other hand never got the main course i finally went and asked and it was delivered cold and overcooked  we have been loyal customers with british airways since i was a little girl every summer we booked airline tickets with this company to visit my grandparents in italy on october th i booked  airline tickets to visit my grandparents leaving october st coming back november th as my grandfather was very sick and didn’t have much longer to live on october th my grandfather passed away we put in a cancellationrefund request because the sole purpose was to see him one last time as british airways did refund us for our tickets but refused to refund us  of our seats even though we never used their services this has been frustrating to deal with on top of the loss of my grandfather in addition every employee we have spoken to on the phone had probably the worse customer service experience i’ve ever encountered  i am beyond disappointed with this company and neither my family nor i will fly with them in the future   nassau to london premium economy on ba is a joke highlighted by my friday morning am breakfast a glass of water and a breakfast box containing a cold sealed in plastic croissant and an equally sealed banana breadcake no hot fooddrink awful that after a night battling with intermittent service on the seat back screen  a screen no larger than in economy the only benefit for the money was early off the plane with luggage prioritised to the collection area the extra leg room was about ok but the seat was simply uncomfortable for a  lb male  yes large but not obese ba premium economy  forget it other airlines do this better  san diego to hannover via london i booked on bacom the longer flights both ways in premium economy  on the return i was informed at san diego that the american airlines flight into dfw was severely delayed and i would miss my flight into london american airlines could book me on a later flight the same day but had only  coach available if i insisted on premier economy i could fly in  days i took the coach and american assured my that ba would refund the fare difference for this downgrade after arrival at home i contacted ba on their website to refund the fare difference a bizarre exchange followed first they said you did not buy any upgraded seat i told them to look at the ticket you cant get a refund because the economy class seat was much more expensive that the booked premium economy seat i contacted ba germany who said you get a refund but you booked this with a travel agent so we are not in charge  i booked with ba on their website they saidthey would send this to london so they can compute the refund but then you cant get a refund because your seat was much more expensive than the premium seat you booked months in advance the change in booking was the sole fault of the delayed american airlines flight this is miserable customer service  london heathrow to stuttgart absolutely disgusted with ba my husband was asked to put his one piece of hand luggage in the hold due to the flight being busy and he agreed ba had one job to do  put it in the hold and make sure it arrives in stuttgart this has proven too difficult the bag is lost and they have not offered any assistance or support  basel to san fransisco via heathrow im convinced the quality has dropped considerably in the past several years i booked world traveller plus or premium economy which costs appr twice as much as economy the flight to sfo was ok seat wise as the plane was an a and i has reserved an aisle seat the food was disgusting for me during the flight we were given a box with several pieces of junk food and shortly before landing given a piece of pizza the choice of food leaves a lot to be desired there were cold drinks offered regularly and you can go to the bulkhead to get extra if needed we were offered maybe two hot drinks during the  hours on the plane longer due to a delay leaving the uk the flight back to the uk was worse since it was a boeing  with the older bulkier seats you couldnt even get to the remote control hidden in the inside of the seat and im not big the recliner didnt work properly and the general space around the seat is cramped as the person next to me spilled over to my seat i feel sorry for larger people the food was just as bland and poor and barely any warm drinks the staff seem challenged with certain situations next time im off to the us i will look for an alternative airline london to bangkok i am not a fan if the ba configuration in business however i did have seat j so it was right up front i am not sure where to begin food awful i ordered beef a showcase of british beef the notes said that was inedible i left most of it instead of asking was something wrong or would i like another meal option the fa took the tray away and asked if i wanted dessert wine  reds  whites and  champagnes  hardly a stellar wine list entertainment small screen with dreadful resolution and a very limited ordinary range of options staff challenged at best clearly some had not been in business before disengaged and disinterested the cabin was over hill for me the toilet was not checked very often a sweet wrapper remained on the toilet floor the entire trip as did an overflowing rubbish bin i would expect much better up the front of the plane we pay a premium to be there and the service and overall product do not match expectations   abu dhabi to london although a ba flight this sector was operated by air belgium and offered a really poor experience aircraft felt old and tired cabin crew were totally indifferent cabin temperature was too hot and stuffy and food totally inedible a really awful flight and worth looking at alternatives if you need to fly this route in the near future  london to los angeles booked this trip eight months previously and as i lost my status on ba a few years ago were forced to pay an additional £ for our two seats the flight i chose was a boeing  and was prepared to part with the extra cash so we could be in the small front cabin never expecting anything to go according to plan with ba and our flight was cancelled a few days before we were rebooked onto a later flight which they changed from an a to a twenty one year old jumbo we were then seated right at the back of club world to benefit from a screaming child sat in the front row of premium we were greeted by a rather pleasant steward who told us he would be looking after us for the trip he then disappeared never to be seen again food was served within an hour of take off for an eleven hour flight the steak so tough was it impossible to cut and could only be eaten by picking up and biting pieces off after a few hours i went  to the galley to seek out a drink as the crew had disappeared stood there being completely ignored by three stewardesses reluctantly one stopped chattering and managed to get me a drink the second meal was served about seven hours after lunch steak sandwich at least that one was edible the seat was as you would expect on such an old plane totally knackered getting out was a task in itself i bought wifi for the whole trip it ran for about  of the flight yet their customer non existent services refuse to refund the payment even though i sent them a whole host of screenshots showing at various times there was no wifi service but they are happy to note the problems we have avoided ba now for some time except where there is no other option as on club europe but with transatlantic they are probably the bottom of the pile we only took this trip to use up some avios they have all been used now and we could come back from lax on virgin atlantic never again ba club world offered is a farce in todays business market  i was in prague flying british airways back to heathrow apparently there were thunderstorms in london so the flights were being delayed my  flight was delayed until  am the next morning there was no british airways person at the prague airport to relay this message some consolidator passed out sheets of paper advising people of the remuneration available to them should they spend the night and wait for the  am flight the sheet of information didnt offer any hotel suggestions or ideas of how to get back into prague this consolidator also mentioned that there was a  flight and there was room for thirty people on this flight so after calling british airways and finding  their offices were  closed for the evening i went  online and booked the flight because of the late timing i was charged usd then after countless emails and hours spent trying to get through on the phone i finally learned that ba would only reimburse me the nonused flight that i had booked  months earlier at a cost of  usd they also said they would send me a  flight voucher not sure how many months it will take until i receive it is there any other airline that doesnt simply rebook a significantly delayed passenger on the next flight and not try to extract outrageous sums from them i will never fly british airways again  london heathrow to new york jfk the first wing at terminal  was rubbish tonight  or so deep and it’s really the only decent part of ba’s ground operation flight left late due to repairs then the usual wait for a tow in at kennedy made us overall late staff very cheerful this route gets decent catering normally but only  main options and the indian chicken was very bland  london heathrow to brindisi we weren’t expecting the long queue for club europe checkin but midafternoon is apparently particularly busy in t galleries south lounge was also teeming but at least the filthy chairs had been replaced and there was a reasonable selection of hot and cold food group boarding was handled efficiently the a was relatively new and clean no pretakeoff drinks were offered departure was delayed by about  minutes but arrival was on time the club europe section was unusually busy with at least ten fully occupied rows including families with preschool children despite the congestion and chaos the food and drink service was handled efficiently although the food was no better than the old world traveller offering it’s hard to see the point of ba’s short haul business class product when the experience is second rate i have ba silver membership this promises fast track choice of seats at booking priority boarding and lounge access i would advise all travellers that in reality these benefits are intermittent at best and unavailable at worst the majority of the time my seat choice is changed fast track at heathrow is slower than the normal queue and the lounges so overcrowded that its sometimes hard to find a seat the iberia lounge at madrid is equality poor with stale tortilla the only offering at breakfast british airways is a rip off i have uploaded by way of example a seat map of their a and seat c this seat is not extra legroom and is cramped like the others yet on bacom they will try to sell it as an exit seat as if it has extra legroom i recently travelled on virgin atlantic and cathay pacific in business and economy and it really struck me just how abysmal baiberia are by comparison  hamburg to london initial flight from london cancelled from under us  days from departure and we had a firm booking to collect a motorhome upon arrival total chaos ground service appalling and no free service on board checkin from hamburg appallingly slow and didnt open until  hrs from departure check in demanded that cabin baggage be checked in while we demanded we keep it all in all an unsatisfactory airline  budapest to london heathrow the flight departed in time and would have arrived ahead of schedule if the gate had not been occupied by the previous aircraft the ride was a bit bumpy but was not too serious the flight was full with kids and the crew did everything to make the journey smooth i did not purchase any food but i saw they ran out of a lot of options due to the unexpected number of onboard purchases singapore to london they wanted to charge me an extra gbp for being over the kg limit the legroom seemed very small to me the flight was super full and i was sitting next to a big woman who spilled over her side of the seat i was asked if i would like tea or coffee with my breakfast and the steward said he will come back with the tea after a long time i managed to catch the same guy walking by and asked him for my tea and he just said that there was no tea   rome to london our flight was delayed from rome by an hour and we could not connect to the next flight to los angeles as we landed in heathrow  minutes before the departure there were no staff members who helped us and they have conveniently put us on the next flight tomorrow they put us on a hotel next to airport and provided dinner but did not provide additional vouchers for snacks and other stuff  london to athens since i started using ba in  i can only say that the quality becomes worse the leg room in business class in a is the same like in economy the only thing that you get is an empty middle seat the meal choices are poor i had to choose between curry and fish pie also they first brought us the starter and the dessert and after  mins once we ate the starter they took the starter plate and they gave us the main the on board service is less attentive than some years ago probably cabin crew are overutilised and want to get some rest which is understandable also due to the plane being late the cabin was not cleaned properly at some point we need to think why would someone choose ba over low cost airlines tickets are priced in a similar way there is no food on board for the economy while for business the portion and variety are a joke leg space is small there are always delays to depart from heathrow not bas fault but at the end of the day i experience delays what is that makes ba in european flights distinct probably nothing  london to paris i wish that they would update their aircraft or perhaps even do a little refurbishing especially when the seats feel worn out and the quality for what you are paying for does not feel worth it that being said this is better than any lowcost carrier  aberdeen to boston via london heathrow i found the seats werent wide enough and leg room was restricted on the way back to london the person in front of me put the seat back as well and this severely decreased and room i had to move also the narrower seats meant that i really had to avoid taking up both arm rests otherwise they were good flights with slightly odd choices but decent food extensive entertainment optionsvariety as well  flew to istanbul with british airways on th june at the passportvisa check desk presented printed boarding pass to the ba lady  my wife was holding the passports the lady looked at the boarding passes and barked passports as if she did not see my wife holding them second bark do you have a visa third bark show me fourth bark next no smile no hello or good morning hardly any eye contact either if anything the situation was worse at boarding ba recently introduced a boardingbygroupnumber system all such systems need to be policed but there are ways of policing the arrangements some passengers attempted to board before their group number was call when caught by the gate keeper they were told not yet some attempted to board prematurely more than once on the second attempt the staff told them to wait accepting that the system must be monitored ba gate staff should be better trained how to deal with potentially anxious passengers and reminded that not everyone speaks or understands english  london to madrid lazy seat allocation has led to my husband and i not sitting together  i understand i can pay to get a seat i want but other than having a seat next to my husband i don’t want any particular seat we are travelling as a pair there are three seats each side of the aisle there will likely be single passengers travelling who have chosen a seat preventing us from sitting together as they don’t know what groups are travelling and do t care where they sit ba bothering to do the seat allocations for all the passengers you don’t wish to pay for specific seats would avoid this   had four flights in total with this airline first flight from dublin to london on th june  was delayed by  hours this delay would have meant we missed our connection in heathrow to miami except that plane was also delayed by  hrs no reason or apologies we arrived in miami hours behind schedule which took away our only evening there as we were getting a cruise the following morning by the time we arrived we had missed our hotel transfer causing further expense as we had to hail a cab our flights home to dublin via heathrow were fine until we reached dublin and realised they had lost our bag despite assurances it would be delivered to our house later that day it was put on the wrong plane  again no apologies given for this inconvenience we are still awaiting the bags arrival and the phone numbers we were given keep ringing out seems like no one cares this was our first and last experience of using ba  johannesburg to heathrow british airways are not doing us proud i recently flew back from south africa with some sports equipment their web site states that you can take sports equipment as part of your luggage allowance but i was charged £ to bring my bike back the check in staff were very forceful and abrupt as i had to bring the bike back i had no choice but to pay when i got back i contacted their customer service they are not willing to help  also the seats are getting really uncomfortable the food is terrible  i have flown british airways numerous times over many years sadly the experience has deteriorated significantly recently and this flight was particularly poor the staff were offhand and one seemed particularly unhappy to be there the person next to me and i asked for the beef choice but were told that there was none left  too little had apparently been loaded there was no apology and we were simply told we needed to make another choice we asked for the fish after some delay we were given our meals but found we had both been given a vegetarian meal i had to walk down to the galley to let them know and was told in a very offhand manner that they must have recorded the wrong choice  no apology eventually we received the fish which by then was dry and not enjoyable we were asked for breakfast choices and gave in cards which stated we wanted a light choice  minutes before landing we were not given anything the service was really poor  and as usual the business seats were falling behind the quality and comfort found in other airlines ba will really have to improve their product to continue to attract premium passengers'"
